All aspects of virtual world display, interaction\nand internetworking can be specified using VRML. It is the intention of its designers that\nVRML become the standard language for interactive simulation within the World Wide\nWeb.\nThe first version of VRML allows for the creation of virtual worlds with limited\ninteractive behavior. These worlds can contain objects which have hyperlinks to other\nworlds, HTML documents or other valid MIME types. When the user selects an object\nwith a hyperlink, the appropriate MIME viewer is launched. When the user selects a link\nto a VRML document from within a correctly configured WWW browser, a VRML\nviewer is launched. Thus VRML viewers are the perfect companion applications to\nstandard WWW browsers for navigating and visualizing the Web. Future versions of\nVRML will allow for richer behaviors, including animations, motion physics and real-\ntime multi-user interaction.\nThis document specifies the features and syntax of Version 1.0 of VRML.\nVRML Mission Statement\nThe history of the development of the Internet has had three distinct phases; first, the\ndevelopment of the TCP/IP infrastructure which allowed documents and data to be stored\nin a proximally independent way; that is, Internet provided a layer of abstraction between\ndata sets and the hosts which manipulated them. While this abstraction was useful, it was\nalso confusing; without any clear sense of \"what went where\", access to Internet was\nrestricted to the class of sysops/net surfers who could maintain internal cognitive maps of\nthe data space.\nNext, Tim Berners-Lee’s work at CERN, where he developed the hypermedia system\nknown as World Wide Web, added another layer of abstraction to the existing structure.\nThis abstraction provided an \"addressing\" scheme, a unique identifier (the Universal\nResource Locator), which could tell anyone \"where to go and how to get there\" for any\npiece of data within the Web. While useful, it lacked dimensionality; there’s no there\nthere within the web, and the only type of navigation permissible (other than surfing) is\nby direct reference. In other words, I can only tell you how to get to the VRML Forum\nhome page by saying, \"http://www.wired.com/\", which is not human-centered data. In\n\nAPPROVED\nfact, I need to make an effort to remember it at all. So, while the World Wide Web\nprovides a retrieval mechanism to complement the existing storage mechanism, it leaves\na lot to be desired, particularly for human beings.\nFinally, we move to \"perceptualized\" Internetworks, where the data has been sensualized,\nthat is, rendered sensually. If something is represented sensually, it is possible to make\nsense of it. VRML is an attempt (how successful, only time and effort will tell) to place\nhumans at the center of the Internet, ordering its universe to our whims. In order to do\nthat, the most important single element is a standard that defines the particularities of\nperception. Virtual Reality Modeling Language is that standard, designed to be a\nuniversal description language for multi-participant simulations.\nThese three phases, storage, retrieval, and perceptualization are analogous to the human\nprocess of consciousness, as expressed in terms of semantics and cognitive science.\nEvents occur and are recorded (memory); inferences are drawn from memory\n(associations), and from sets of related events, maps of the universe are created (cognitive\nperception). What is important to remember is that the map is not the territory, and we\nshould avoid becoming trapped in any single representation or world-view. Although we\nneed to design to avoid disorientation, we should always push the envelope in the kinds\nof experience we can bring into manifestation!\nThis document is the living proof of the success of a process that was committed to being\nopen and flexible, responsive to the needs of a growing Web community. Rather than re-\ninvent the wheel, we have adapted an existing specification (Open Inventor) as the basis\nfrom which our own work can grow, saving years of design work and perhaps many\nmistakes. Now our real work can begin; that of rendering our noospheric space.\nHistory\nVRML was conceived in the spring of 1994 at the first annual World Wide Web\nConference in Geneva, Switzerland. Tim Berners-Lee and Dave Raggett organized a\nBirds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session to discuss Virtual Reality interfaces to the World Wide\nWeb. Several BOF attendees described projects already underway to build three\ndimensional graphical visualization tools which interoperate with the Web. Attendees\nagreed on the need for these tools to have a common language for specifying 3D scene\ndescription and WWW hyperlinks -- an analog of HTML for virtual reality. The term\nVirtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) was coined, and the group resolved to begin\nspecification work after the conference. The word ’Markup’was later changed to\n’Modeling’to reflect the graphical nature of VRML.\n\nAPPROVED\nShortly after the Geneva BOF session, the www-vrml mailing list was created to discuss\nthe development of a specification for the first version of VRML. The response to the list\ninvitation was overwhelming: within a week, there were over a thousand members. After\nan initial settling-in period, list moderator Mark Pesce of Labyrinth Group announced his\nintention to have a draft version of the specification ready by the WWW Fall 1994\nconference, a mere five months away. There was general agreement on the list that, while\nthis schedule was aggressive, it was achievable provided that the requirements for the\nfirst version were not too ambitious and that VRML could be adapted from an existing\nsolution. The list quickly agreed upon a set of requirements for the first version, and\nbegan a search for technologies which could be adapted to fit the needs of VRML.\nThe search for existing technologies turned up a several worthwhile candidates. After\nmuch deliberation the list came to a consensus: the Open Inventor ASCII File Format\nfrom Silicon Graphics, Inc. The Inventor File Format supports complete descriptions of\n3D scenes with polygonally rendered objects, lighting, materials, ambient properties and\nrealism effects. A subset of the Inventor File Format, with extensions to support\nnetworking, forms the basis of VRML. Gavin Bell of Silicon Graphics has adapted the\nInventor File Format for VRML, with design input from the mailing list. SGI has publicly\nstated that the file format is available for use in the open market, and have contributed a\nfile format parser into the public domain to bootstrap VRML viewer development.\n\nAPPROVED\nA Graphical Representation of Inverse VRML Uptake\nChange the number in red below to adjust for download rate and/or bandwidth.\n1\nThe number 1 represents an engineer with an \"average\" cube *\nCF\nMin\nfsw\nAir\nEANx\n32%\nEANx\n36%\n80.0 149.12\n0\n61.4 114.43\n10\n49.8 92.846\n20\n41.9 78.102\n30\n180\n36.2 67.402\n40\n120\n31.8 59.275\n50\n80.0\n147.0\n192.0\n28.4\n52.9\n60\n57.0\n92.0\n123.0\n25.6 47.774\n70\n40.0\n65.0\n79.0\n23.4 43.543\n80\n30.0\n49.0\n59.0\n21.5 40.001\n90\n24.0\n37.0\n45.0\n19.9\n37\n100\n19.0\n30.0\n35.0\n18.5 34.409\n110\n16.0\n25.0\n29.0\n17.3 32.154\n120\n13.0\n20.0\nn/a\n16.2 30.178\n130\n10.0\n17.0\nn/a\n15.1 28.202\n140\n8.0\nn/a\nn/a\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\nDays after download\nInverse usage\nProgrammers\nTechnical Writers\nQA\nOther\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\nDays after download\nInverse log usage\nArtists\nMusicians\nPoliticians\nDentists"}
