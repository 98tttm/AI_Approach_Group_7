Android boasts a\nhealthy array of connectivity options,including wifi,bluetooth and wireless data over a cellular connection. The\ncontrolling of appliances can be done either by using a server module. Here the controller is loaded with a program\nwritten using Embedded c language. The main objective of this project is to help for physically disabled persons\nspecifically those who are unable to walk.\nMINI PROJECT\nPROJECT NAME : COIRFED SYSTEM\nCoirfed system is used to develop the small scale coir production to large scale production. In this project we\nare dealing with the stock entry details of various products,salary details of labours and details of wholesale dealers\netc. In the existing system we have done it by manual and it is time consuming. In the proposed system we have done\nit by computer so the data entry and accessing the details of labour and products will be more accurate and easier.\nSEMINARS AND PRESENTATIONS\nPresented seminar on the curriculam section entitled as “VIRTUAL REALITY APPLICATIONS” :\nVirtual reality is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user\ninterfaces, virtual reality places the user inside an experience instead of viewing a screen in front of person,\nusers are immersed and able to interact with 3D world. The device used here is head mounted display and\nthe technology used is CAVE technology. The main application of virtual reality is in military-this includes\nall three services (army,navy,and air force) where it is used for training purposes.
