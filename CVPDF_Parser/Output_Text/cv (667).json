Copper slag is the\nwaste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such\nthat each ton of copper generates approximately 2.5 tons of\ncopper  slag.  Copper  slag  is  one  of  the  materials  that  is\nconsidered as a waste which could have a promising future in\nconstruction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates.\nFor this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests\nwere  conducted  for  various  proportions  of  copper  slag\nreplacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained\nresults were compared with those of control concrete made with\nordinary Portland cement and sand.\nWorking Experience\nWorked as a Site Engineer & AutoCAD Designer in\nMeeran Construction, Tirunelveli, from May 2011 to June 2013\nRESUME\n\n\nReading Books\nCompetencies:\n\nGood team player, Fast\nLearner.\n\nOrganized and well structured \nat work.\n\nCommitted to deadlines and \nschedules.\n\nHonest, Sincere with a high \nlevel of Integrity.\nResponsibilities\n\nEnsuring that all assigned work is completed on time and \nwithin agreed budgets.\n\nSupervising Projects: including in house, external \ncontractors and sub-contractors.\n\nSetting out Project works in accordance with Drawings &\nSpecification\n\nMaintenance of daily records. \nDECLARATION\n              \nI hereby declare that the above information’s are true to the \nbest of my knowledge.\nThanking you,\nYours faithfully,\n                                                                  Yusuf Haja.
