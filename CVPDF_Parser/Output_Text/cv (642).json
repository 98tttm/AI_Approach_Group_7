Qualifications include Master’s degree from VIT University,\nVellore specialized in Power Electronics and Drives, Experienced in commercial software’s like MATLAB,\nANSYS, PSIM etc.\nEXPERIENCE \nWorked as a Intern (Electrical Engineer) in SCM DATA, Hyderabad   8 Jun 2016 to 22 Dec 2017\n\nDesign of EV (Electric Vehicle) Motor \nDescription: Electric vehicle motors are the most popular motors and upcoming generation is totally related\nwith the EV motors to reduce emissions from vehicles. EV motors are operated through the Power\nelectronic devices and batteries. The AC motors are most popular due to the VFD (Variable frequency\ndrives). AC motors are most efficient and economical for medium and high loads.\nDesign of Induction motors 70kW and 120kW for electric vehicles.  Particularly involvement in this\nproject is design and development of electric motor parts based on theoretical calculations done by hand\nafter implemented in excel and numerical solutions implemented in FEA software. Design of new product\ndevelopment and reverse engineering done for electric vehicle applications.\nRoles and Responsibilities:\nResponsible for providing Theoretical and numerical simulations using Ansys Electromagnetic suite and\nMATLAB. Involved in product and process design of electromechanical systems and vehicle dynamics and\npre- requirements of motors.\nDuties include,\n\nDesign of 70kW and 120kW motors based on the vehicle requirement.\n\nDesign of new product development for different electrical parts.\n\nResearch and develop ideas for new product and production systems.\n\nDeliver product based theoretical calculations.\n\nProvide design support at all stages of design process to internal members and external clients.\n\nImprove the design, performance, and optimization of existing products.\n\nEnhance cost efficiency of products with set quality standards of the company.\nSoftware’s: ANSYS Electromagnetic suite (RMxPRT, Mawell2D/3D, Simplorer) and MATLAB\nWorked as a Summer Intern BHEL, Hyderabad     15 Dec to 29 Dec 2014\n\nStudy of manufacturing of Turbo Generator\n\nEDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION\n\nMasters in Power Electronics & Devices from VIT University, (Vellore, TamilNadu),2016 – 8.22 \n\nBachelor of Technology (Electrical & Electronics) from KMM Institute of Technology & Science,\n(Affiliated to JNTU Ananthapuramu, Andhra Pradesh),2014 – 74.77 %\n\nIntermediate (MPC) from Sri Chaithanya Jr. College, (Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh) ,2010- 85.9 %\n\nSSC from Teja High School, (Vempalli, Andhra Pradesh),2008 - 80.33 %\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\n\nTechnical Languages\n: MATLAB, PSIM, OrCARD, KEIL & ANSYS Electromagnetic suite\n\nIT Languages\n: C\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nD.Sreekanth reddy, “Control of two-phase induction and synchronous motor drives using direct torque\ncontrol”, International Journal of Engineering Research online, Volume No.3, Issue No 6, Year 2015.\n\nD.Sreekanth reddy,Kasina v cs Srikanth,V.Ramaraju,D.Elangovan “Interleaved Dual Switch Isolated\nDC to DC Converter with Voltage Tripler for Fuel cell Applications”, In IOSR-JEEE e-ISSN: 2278-\n1676, p-ISSN: 2320-3331, Volume 11, Issue 5 Ver.
