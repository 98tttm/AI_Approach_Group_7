Only those who possess a\nsecret  key can  decipher  the  message  into  plain  text.  Encrypted\nmessages  can  sometimes  be  broken  by cryptanalysis, also called\ncodebreaking,  although  modern  cryptography  techniques  are\nvirtually unbreakable .As the Internet and other forms of electronic\ncommunication  become  more  prevalent,  electronic  security is\nbecoming increasingly important. Cryptography is used to protect e-\nmail messages, credit card information, and corporate data. One of\nthe most popular cryptography systems used on the Internet is Pretty\nGood Privacy because it's effective and free. \nThis project is based on this on”symmetric key cryptography”. An\nencryption system in which the sender and receiver of a message\nshare a single, common key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the\nmessage. Symmetric-key systems are simpler and faster, but their\nmain drawback is that the two parties must somehow exchange the\nkey in a secure way.\nSkills:\nMANUAL TESTING\nA budding professional with extensive conceptual knowledge in Software Testing\nDemonstrated exposure in full life-cycle implementations with skills in executing \nSoftware Development life cycle (SDLC)  & different Models of SDLC\n \nGood knowledge on STLC, Manual Testing, Types of testing,\nDecent information of Build, Re-spin, Release\nGood knowledge on writing Test Case, Test plan, Reviewing Process.\nKnowledge on Defect, Defect cycle\n\nGood knowledge on Defect Tracking Tool – Bugzilla\nTraining Attended :                                                                                                   \nTejas –TSSC Certification Program in Telecom Technology, At  Sadguru Shikhanpratista.\nISO 9001: Auditor/Lead Auditor course.\n \nWORK EXPERIENCE:                                                                                            \nCompany Name :  QMS Certification Services Pvt.
