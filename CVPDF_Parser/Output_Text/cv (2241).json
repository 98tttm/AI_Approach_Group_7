This has happened in a \nrelatively short span of time, particularly after the Electricity Act of 2003 gave the \nnecessary impetus. The Act recognized “power trading” as a distinct activity due to which \nshort-term traded volumes and the number of market participants have been on a rise. \n \n \n \nACADEMIC PROFILE \n \n \n \n \nEducation \nDiscipline / \nBoard/ \nYear of \nSCORE \nSpecialization \nUniversity \nCompletion \nMBA \nPower \nUniversity of Petroleum \n2013-2015 CGPA=3.57/ \nManagement \nand Energy Studies, \n4 \nDehradun \nB.E \nElectrical and \nAnna University, Chennai \n2011 \n80.02% \nElectronics \nIntermediate \nScience \nBihar Intermediate \n2005 \n60.4% \nEducation Council,Patna \nMatriculation \nPCM \nBihar School \n2003 \n74.1% \nExamination \nBoard,Patna \n\n \nTECHANICAL SKILLS \n \n \n \nAutomation Exposure at Sofcone India Pvt.Ltd. \n \n• PLCs: Allen Bradley (Micrologix1000, SLC 5/03), Siemens (S7-200, S7-300), Modicon \n(TSX Micro 3705) & Mitsubishi (FX-series) \n \nLadder & Logic Development Wiring & Troubleshooting. \n• SCADA: Wonder ware’s In touch, RS View, Application & Development. \n \n• Process Instrumentation: RTDS, Thermocouples, Level Sensor, Flow sensor, Proximity \nSensors, Relays, Contactors, Thermal overload relays. \n \n• Motors/ Starters/ Control Circuits: Induction Motors, Torque/ Speed characteristics, \nStar Delta Starters, DOL Starters, Reversing starters, interlocking circuits, Wiring. \nKnowledge of PLC wiring, source & sink concepts. \n \n• Variable Speed Drive: Knowledge of Programming, its Variable speed & Torque \nCharacteristics, Energy saving concepts. \n \n• HMI (panel View 300 Micro): Creating Applications, Downloading / Uploading Program, \nCommunication with PLC. \n \n• DCS: Flexlogix, Introduction to DCS Hardware, Application and hands on practical on \nDCS. \n \n• Panel designing: Contactor sizing and Bus bar sizing, Load calculation and Panel \nprotect. \n \n• AutoCAD \n \n• Solar PVsyst \n \n• MS Office and Internet Application \n \n• ETAP \n \nCertificates \nElectrical Design Engineering \nInstitute: \nSmart Brains Institute of Engineering Design & Research. \n \nLanguages known: English, Hindi, Tamil,Punjabi,Gujarati. \n \n \n \n \nEXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES \n \n• Participated in debates, dramatics and quiz events at school and college levels. \n• Actively participated in sports events at school and college level. \n• Participated in various Cultural activities at graduateandpostgraduatelevel. \n• Organised various college events and acted as executive manager in inter college \nfesting raduation. \n\n \n \nDECLARATION \n \nI here by certify that all the information provided here is correct to the best \nof my knowledge and belief. \n \n \nABHISHEK KR.
