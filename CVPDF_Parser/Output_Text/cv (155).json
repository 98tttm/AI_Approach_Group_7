Air leakage detector is a project to intimate the alarm signal when there is any leakage in the\ntank. T he field of mechanical engineering has a theme word called change as its backbone. In our\nproject the main parameter is pneumatic pressure (30m to 40m bar).\n                     The main components of project are sensor units, microcontroller units, power supply units,\ndisplay units. Sensor are using for detection of electromagnetic radiation from the natural sources. Then\nthis signal will transfer to microcontroller units. The main function of microcontroller is storage unit.\nThen this data will transfer to display unit as a buzzer sounds.\n.  \n1\n\nEXPERIENCE\nCompany: LOIUS & SONS\nPosition: FIRE FIGHTING TECHNICIAN\nPeriod: APR 2016 – JAN 2017\nDuties & Responsibilities\n\nTo visit and inspect sites for their fire prevention system installation for sanction of fire safety\ncertificates\n\nAttend to all calls and resolve customer queries pertaining to various fire related issues\n\nMaintain best possible working conditions with regards to fire safety\n\nImpart  training  to  subordinates  and  new  joiners  for  operating  fire  equipment  and  other\nfirefighting services\n\nTo help organizations design and develop fire exit plans\n\nTo coordinate with event organizers for installing necessary fire systems\n\nAssist Chief Investigating Officer in examining the causes of fire\n\nRegularly check all fire extinguishers and fire equipment for serviceability\n\nMaintain record of all fire services delivered\n\nGenerate necessary reports for management to review daily performance\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\n2\n\n\nDIPLOMA IN AUTOCAD (Duration: 1 month)\nMS OFFICE \nQA/QC\nNDT\n1.
