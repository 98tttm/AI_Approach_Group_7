Higher temperature can blast the \ntransformer. From this display indication we limit the load current in order \nto avoid bursting of transformer we need to maintain load current \nconstantly and if the temperature value increase beyond predefined value, \nit’s alerted by using an alarm circuit.  \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nEXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\nDECLARATION\nADDITIONAL COURSES \nPAPER PRESENTATIONWORKSHOPS/INDUSTRIAL VISIT\nEXPERIANCE"}
