The bicycle fabricated was single framed with a bent below the \ndriver’s seat which acted as a suspension system.\n\nDevelopment of Electronically Controlled Proportioning Directional Servo Valve \nsponsored by KSCST, Bangaluru\nDescription: In this project, flow rate and pressure of hydraulic system is controlled by\nintelligent electronic system. Directional Control Valve and DC Servo Motor is joined by\nflexible coupling and then connected to hydraulic system and the electronic system. Thus,\nthrough stepwise movement of spool of DCV, hydraulic system can be controlled as\ndesired.\nAchievements:\n\nSecured 91/100 in Mechanics of Materials(Top ten in University)\n\nFounded SAEINDIA BIET Collegiate Club\n\nTeam Captain of SUPRA-SAEINDIA\nSoftware Skills:\n\nSolid Edge, ANSYS, SSCNC and Master CAM\nExtra-Curricular Activities:\n\nParticipated in TECHSPIN’12 conducted by SDM, Dharwad\n\nParticipated in Quiz Competition organized on Feb 28, 2012 by Science Forum, BIET"}
