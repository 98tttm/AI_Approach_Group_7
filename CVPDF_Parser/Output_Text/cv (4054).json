It presents a design of a low-cost; high-efficiency drive capable of supplying\na single-phase a.c induction motor with a PWM modulated sinusoidal voltage . The circuit \noperation is controlled by an microcontroller. The device is aimed at substituting the \ncommonly used triac phase angle control drives.\nThe drive uses a PWM controlled MOSFET and the load in series with a bridge rectifier. This\ndrive based on this new control technique is targeted for use in consumer and industrial \nproducts: washing machine, dishwashers, ventilators, compressors, and wherever the system \ncost is a consideration.\nIndustrial Training: \n\n45 days Summer  Training  from  N.T.P.C.(National  Thermal\nPower corporation ltd.),Badarpur,New Delhi_110044.\n\nN.T.P.C. is a govt. of india enterprises.\n\nFrom 15/06/10 to 20/07/10.\nTrained here as:\n\nSite Engg(Electrical)\n\nGets skills about substation installation of  400/220kV.\n         Various transmission knowledge\nTechnical\n \n  skills\n \n :\n\n\nLanguages: C\n\nKnowledge of MS Project\n\nMatlab Simulation\nProfessional Qualification:     \nExam Details\nCollege/University\nYear Of Passing\ndivision\n \nB.TECH(EEE\nENGG)\nM.D.U(HARYANA)\n2012\n1st \nAcademic Qualification:   \n              \nExam Details\nCollege/University\nYear Of Passing\nDivison\nIntermediate\nB.S.E.B PATNA\n2007\n2nd \nMatriculation\nB.S.E.B PATNA\n2005\n2nd \nPassport Details:\nPassport No.\nDate of issue\nPlace of issue\nDate of Expiry\nM8780042\n24/04/2015\nPATNA\n23/04/2025\nAchievement: \n\n3rd  rank in 5th &6th  semester in B.TECH\n\n1st  rank in 7th & 8th  semester in B.TECH\nSpecial skills :                                                                                                                          \nOperating system                                                      window XP/2007  &Windows 8  & 10      \nWord processing                                                        MS- office                                                 \nProfessional Strength:                                                                                           \n\nAlways recognized for outstanding work ethics, integrity, thoroughness and Commitment to \norganizations benefit.
