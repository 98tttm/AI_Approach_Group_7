PROJECT (PGDISHE):- “CHEMICAL RISK ANALYSIS”\n              Safely managing the chemical in workplace is good for business and it is good for\neveryone!\nIt will improve employees’ safety and health. It will potentially introduce cost saving,\nthrough more effective work practice such as correct storage, handling, use and disposal\nprocedure. Potential harm to the environment will also be reduced. This chemical safety\nguide is intended for small businesses. In particular, it provides guidance for completing\nour chemical  risk analysis. A chemical risk analysis follows the same steps as a risk\nanalysis for any other hazards in your workplace. There are three basic steps:\nIdentify the hazard:  This involves identifying the chemical in our workplace and the\nhazards associated with them\nAssess  the  risk: This  involve  assessing  the  risk  from  chemical  or  process  in  our\nworkplace\nControl the exposure: This involves considering the various recognized control measures\nto eliminate or reduce the risk.\n 3.

FINAL YEAR PROJECT (B.E.) :- “FLEXIBLE CONVEYOR”\n             These conveyors can be used for any kind of loading and transporting of goods\nwith efficient mode of moving bulk materials. The high flexibility and the wide range make\nit possible to use the conveyors in both permanent lines as well as in flexible modularized\nsolutions. This is link mechanism conveyor which can be used for small units where the\nconveyor kept in small space, can be compressed and stretched to the required length and\ncurvature and the jobs can roll on it through gravity to reach the destination for which\nhardly two people are required to transfer the material.\nAfter the completion of the project work we tried its working in our college machine shop\nand we were pleased to note that it does meet the requirements for what it is meant.\nDeclaration:\n         I hereby declare that all the details furnished above are true to the best of my \nknowledge.\nDate:  /  /       Place: Bharuch                                            (Gajanan S.
