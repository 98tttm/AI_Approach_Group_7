Worked on environmental compliance and \npermitting for individual dairies and collected and compiled literature on the fate \nof hormones associated with concentrated animal feeding operations. \nEcological Consultant to City of Los Angeles, Pacifica Services, Inc.  \nAs part of a large-scale project ensuring future water supply to the city of Los \nAngeles and the maintenance of healthy vegetation in Owens Valley, I \nmanaged several tasks within the project: successional vegetation dynamics \nfollowing agricultural abandonment; relationship between groundwater depth \nand individual plant species; relationship between vegetation productivity and \nwater availability. I managed and budgeted tasks, participated in project \nmeetings, and coordinated with client personnel. I designed experiments and \nsupervised staff in vegetation data collection, collected and analyzed vegetation \ndynamics data in relation to groundwater levels, and authored manuscripts, \nreports and presentations. I further parameterized and assisted with EDYS \nupdates, a landscape-level ecological model. 2003 - 2005 \nVisiting Professor and Postdoctoral Research Assistant, University of \nNevada, Las Vegas. Analyzed environmental and physiological factors \naffecting photosynthesis in desert shrubs under ambient and elevated CO2 to \ndevelop seasonal gas exchange model. Designed field and greenhouse \nexperiments and participated in proposal writing. Supervised undergraduate \nassistants. 2000 – 2002 \nEcophysiological Research Assistant, Duke University  \nDesigned and conducted experiments testing for species differences in dynamic \nphotosynthetic responses to changes in light intensity in ambient and elevated \nCO2. Coded and parameterized dynamic photosynthesis model. Maintained \nphotosynthesis analyzers, data loggers, “baby-Kucera” sapflow gauges, \nradiation sensors. 1996 - 2000 \nEcological Research Assistant, Northern Arizona University \nDesigned and conducted field study on the relationship between ponderosa \npine stand structure, light environment and grass species presence and \nabundance as well as a greenhouse experiment evaluating effect of shade on \nnative grass species. Hired, trained, and supervised student workers for \nbiomass harvest. Assisted professor in writing McIntire-Stennis proposal to fund \nthesis research. 1994 - 1996 \nChemical Research Technician, Northern Arizona University \nSet up laboratory and gas chromatographs for resin acid and terpene analysis. \nAdapted resin acid analysis to ponderosa pine needles. 1994 \nGreenhouse Research Aide, Northern Arizona University \nPropagated and maintained tree seedlings in greenhouse facility for field \n\nElke Naumburg Resume \n \n \n \n2\nSELECTED \nPROJECT \nEXPERIENCE   \n(con’t) \ntransplanting. Installed drip irrigation. Analyzed terpenes in ponderosa pine \nneedles. Supervised and trained high school summer workers. 1991 - 1993 \nAgricultural Research Assistant, Technical University Munich, Germany \nOversaw vegetable experiments and analyzed their nutritional quality; handled \ndata/statistical analyses; supervised/trained apprentices. 1986 – 1990 \nFIELD EQUIPMENT \nAnalyzed hemispherical photographs, evaluated hydraulic conductivity and \nsusceptibility to cavitation by plant stems (centrifuge method), used and \nserviced photosynthesis analyzers (CIRAS I, LI 6400), data loggers (Campbell, \nDelta-T, LI 1000), spectroradiometer (LI 1600), “Baby Kucera” sapflow system, \nradiation sensors (GaAsP 1118 photodiodes by Hamamatsu, LI-190), leaf area \nmeters (CID, AgVis video camera/computer system) & Scion Image software. \nUtilized woody and herbaceous vegetation survey procedures. \nEDUCATION \nPhD Plant Physiological Ecology, Duke University, 2000 \nMS Forest Ecology, University of Northern Arizona, 1996 \nBS Forest Management (summa cum laude), University of Northern Arizona, 1994 \nSCIENTIFIC \nPUBLICATIONS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBarker, DH ; Vanier, C; Naumburg, E; Charlet, TN; Nielsen, KM; Newingham, BA; \nSmith, SD. 2006.
