The project also entailed dam Investigation,\nwhere a trial pit was dug at the reservoir to ascertain the type of soil and its\ncharacteristics to retain water. Vertical electrical soundings were also executed\nat the dam axis or the dam embankment to determine the type and the strength of\nrocks to withstand the force of water and its weight.\nProject Name: Sogoo water project-Narok\nRole: Geotechnical expert\nProject Detail\nTeam Size: 3\nProject Duration: 1 Day\nThe project entailed the mapping of the subsurface so as to advice on the best\nintake tank site location in reference to the basement rock type. The project also\nentailed treatment tank site investigation, where a trial pit was dug to ascertain\nthe type of soil and its characteristics to control waste Seepage. Vertical\nelectrical soundings were also executed to determine the type and the strength of\nrocks. A trial pit was also dug at some other point for a tank site investigation.\nLater the soil samples were send to the laboratory for analysis and to determine\ntheir atterberg limits.\nProject Name: Olopikidongoe water project-Narok\nRole: Hydro-geologist \nand Geotechnical expert\nTeam Size: 3\nProject Duration: 1 Day\nProject Detail\nIt comprised of pan investigation, borehole survey and septic tank site\ninvestigation. A number of VES were executed with trial pits done. All\nthese were ascertain the subsurface conditions of the rocks and soil.\nProject Name: Bungoma county-Borehole supervision\nRole: Hydro-geologist\nProject Detail\nTeam Size: 4\nProject Duration: 3 Day\nThe project entailed geological logging,  geophysical logging,  and  test\npumping Exercise to determine the aquifer characteristics\nProject Name: KRCS-Nalekat Duba pump\nRole: Hydro geologist\nProject Detail\nTeam Size: 4\nProject Duration: 3 Day\nSupervision of borehole test pumping exercise at Nalekat Duba pump-Pokot\nEast Red cross of Kenya.\nProject Name: Merti project\nRole: Hydro geologist\nTeam Size: 15\nProject Duration: 3 Year\n\n \nProject Detail\nI had the privilege to take part in part of the project. It was a three year\nProject sponsored by both the national government and NGOs.The project\nwas  cutting across Garissa, Marsabit and Wajir Counties. The aim was to\nmap the aquifers  within the region so as to advice on the best site for\nboreholes development to meet the high demand for water due to scanty\nrainfall throughout the year.\nEDUCATION\nDegree/Course\nPercentage/CGPA\nYear of Passing\nBachelor's degree in Geology\nSecond Class Honours \n(Upper Division)\n2017\nSouth Eastern Kenya University \nKenya certificate of secondary Education\nBungoma high school\nB (Plain)\nA-(Minus)\n2012\n2008\nKenya Certificate of Primary Education\nAll Saints Academy\nACHIEVEMENTS\nCreated a geological\nDatabase, Carried out \ngeophysical exploration \nand geotechnical \nsurveys.
