Ms. Naumburg managed and budgeted tasks, \nparticipated in project meetings, and coordinated with client \npersonnel. She designed experiments and supervised staff in \nvegetation data collection, collected and analyzed vegetation \ndynamics data in relation to groundwater levels, and authored \nmanuscripts, reports and presentations. She further parameterized \nand assisted with EDYS updates, a landscape-level ecological model. \n2003 - 2005\nPostdoctoral Research Assistant, University of Nevada, Las \nVegas. Analyzed environmental and physiological factors affecting \nphotosynthesis in desert shrubs under ambient and elevated CO2 to \ndevelop seasonal gas exchange model. Designed field and \ngreenhouse experiments and participated in proposal writing. \nSupervised undergraduate assistants. 2000 – 2002\nEcophysiological Research Assistant, Duke University \nDesigned and conducted experiments testing for species differences \nin dynamic photosynthetic responses to changes in light intensity in \nambient and elevated CO2. Coded and parameterized dynamic \nphotosynthesis model. Maintained photosynthesis analyzers, data \nloggers, “baby-Kucera” sapflow gauges, radiation sensors. 1996 - \n2000\nEcological Research Assistant, Northern Arizona University\nDesigned and conducted field study on the relationship between \nponderosa pine stand structure, light environment and grass species \npresence and abundance as well as a greenhouse experiment \nevaluating effect of shade on native grass species. Hired, trained, and\nsupervised student workers for biomass harvest. Assisted professor in\nwriting McIntire-Stennis proposal to fund thesis research. 1994 - 1996\nChemical Research Technician, Northern Arizona University\nElke Naumburg Resume\n1\n\nSELECTED \nPROJECT \nEXPERIENCE\n(con’t)\nSet up laboratory and gas chromatographs for resin acid and terpene \nanalysis.
