{"id": "cv (1631).pdf", "text": "What is electroplating?\nElectroplating is widely used in various industries for coating metal objects with a thin layer\nof a different metal. The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the \nmetal of the object lacks.\nWhy Electroplating?\nElectroplating is known as electro deposition because the process involves depositing a thin \nlayer of metal onto the surface of a work piece, which is referred to as the substrate. An \nelectric current is used to cause the desired reaction.\nProcess of Electroplating?\nA coating is a covering that is applied to the surface of an object, usually referred to as the \nsubstrate. The purpose of applying the coating may be decorative, functional, or both. \nThe coating itself may be an all-over coating, completely covering the substrate, or it may \nonly cover parts of the substrate.\nFactors that impact the final plating result include:\n\nthe chemical composition and temperature of the bath\n\nthe voltage level of the electric current\n\nthe distance between the anode and the cathode\n\nthe electrical current application's length of time\nBenefits of Electroplating:\n\nMany metals posses conductive properties. Conductive metals are incredibly helpful \nin making the electronics, aeronautic, automobile, and communications industries.\n\nMany types of industrial electroplating create a barrier on the substrate that protects \nit against atmospheric conditions such as corrosion,\n\n\nEver metal has its purposes, as a result using metals for their hardness, others for \ntheir ductility, or their resistance to corrosion is normal.\n\nElectroplating is sometimes used to make brittle materials stronger and more \ndurable.\n\nPlating with these metals protect engine parts and components from damage caused\nby extreme temperatures, which can increase their lifespan\n\nPlated surfaces are less susceptible to damage when struck or dropped, which can \nincrease their lifespan.\n\nIt is a cost-effective and efficient conductivity solution\n\nDamage caused by arcing and shorts in electrical parts and components due to \nwhiskers breaking away from materials can be significantly reduced"}
