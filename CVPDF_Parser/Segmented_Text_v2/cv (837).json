I believe that I have the required\nposition is outlined below.",
    "WORK EXPERIENCE": "Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. My main areas of research interests are in parallel and\ndistributed computer architectures, cluster computing, interconnection networks, on-chip interconnects, multi-core/SoC\narchitectures, mobile computing, Internet QoS, performance evaluation, and fault-tolerant computing. These areas cover most of the\ntopics listed in the advertisement for the Computer System Architecture Program. I have published extensively in these areas in\nmajor international journals such as the IEEE Transactions on Computers (TC), IEEE Trans. on Parallel and Distributed Systems\n(TPDS), and Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC), and highly selective conference proceedings such as ISCA,\nHPCA, SIGMETRICS, MICRO, ICDCS, IPDPS, SPAA, and FTCS/DSN. I have served on the Program Committee of most of these\nconferences, and have served on the Editorial Boards of the IEEE TC and TPDS, the two premier journals in the architecture area. I\nwas the Program Chair of the 12th HPCA, HPCA-2006.\nMy research has been continuously supported by NSF, in particular the Architecture Program, since 1988. I have been funded by\nboth the CCF and CNS divisions from four different programs (Architecture, Distributed Systems, Security, and Wireless\nNetworks). In addition, I have an ongoing CISE/Research Infrastructure grant. I have participated in many CAREER and regular\nproposal review panels for almost 20 years and was a member of the Committee of Visitors for the CNS program in 2006.  Thus, I\nhave a broad background in many overlapping areas with architecture and I believe such a background is essential for steering the\narchitecture research in the coming years.\nIn addition to the current research themes as outlined in the job description, I envision to explore other new/challenging research\nareas in computer architecture such as nano-computing, bio-inspired computing, memory and I/O systems, and architecture-level\nsupport for virtualization and security. Specifically, I would like to expand the scope of the architecture research starting from the\nlow-level micro-architecture/VLSI design to compiler, OS and applications. Since I am familiar with the relevant Programs in both\nthe CCF and CNS divisions, I should be able to strengthen the Architecture Research Program during my tenure at NSF.\nI have enclosed a copy of my resume along with this letter. Please let me know if you need any additional information.\nThank you for considering my application.\nSincerely,\nChita R. Das\nProfessor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.\nAn Equal Opportunity University\nCollege of Engineering"
