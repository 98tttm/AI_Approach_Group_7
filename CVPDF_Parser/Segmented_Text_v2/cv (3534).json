Carefully selected manufacturing methods, fabrication and product designs.Identified\ndesign, process and equipment options to satisfy client needs, minimize costs and limit potential operational\nproblems. Developed, coordinated, and monitored all aspects of production including selection of\nmanufacturing methods, fabrication, and operation of product designs.\nTitle\n:\nThermal and Structural Analysis of Friction Welded Dissimilar Material\nDescription   :\nIn this work, the relation between the response Tensile Strength and the input parameters were\nstudied for the weld between Medium Carbon Steel and Stainless Steel. It was observed that the\nmaximum strength value was obtained during optimum input parameter setting, In this relation\nthere are different Mechanical Testings are carried out such as Tensile Test, Impact and Izod\nTest, Hardness Test, Bending Test, Microstructure Analysis which results give Higher Integrity\nof Welded joints and the breakdown of metals carried on outside portion of the Welded Zone\nDuration       :   Six Months\n:  Team Lead",
