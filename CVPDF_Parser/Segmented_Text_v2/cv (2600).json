Pelton turbine is most efficient at this condition. Thus, more power power can\nbe extracted from a water source with high pressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure\nand high flow, even when the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made\nin all sizes.\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING\n1.
