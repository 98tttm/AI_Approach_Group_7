Honors students in these areas. My research results have appeared in top quality international\njournals (such as IEEE TPDS, IEEE TC, JPDC) and highly selective conference proceedings (such as\nISCA, HPCA, MICRO, SIGMETRICS, ICDCS, ICPP, IPDPS, ICS, ISPLED, and SPAA), and the research\nhas been supported by various funding agencies. In the last ﬁve years, I have been a PI/Co-PI of reserch\ngrants totaling to more than $5.8M. Here is a brieﬂy description of my contributions in each of these areas\n(with pointers to selected publications) followed by an outline of my current research work.\nEvaluation of Multiprocessor Architectures\nPerformance and dependability (reliability/availability) evaluation of multiprocessor architectures is essen-\ntial to assess whether a design meets the high-level requirements, to identify design bottlenecks, to select\nan optimal architecture for speciﬁc requirements, and to design better systems in the future. However, eval-\nuation of such architectures becomes extremely complex when the underlying communication network is\nincluded in the model. Therefore, most prior research refrained from including the network architecture in\nevaluating multiprocessor systems.\nThe uniqueness of my evaluation work is the inclusion of the underlying interconnection network in de-\nveloping performance, dependability, and performance-related dependability (performability) models for\nvarious parallel machines. We have developed elegant performance and dependability models for various\narchitectures such as bus-based systems [1], hypercubes ([10], [14], [24], [44], [53]), MIN-based systems\n([11], [22], [47]), mesh-connected systems [18], k-ary-n-cubes [77], and clusters [12]. Speciﬁcally, the\nanalytical model for the hypercube network with wormhole switching mechanism [51] was the ﬁrst accu-\nrate technique that captured the chained blocking possible in wormhole switching. This work received the\nIEEE Computer Society Outstanding Paper Award at the International Conference on Distributed Comput-\ning Systems (ICDCS), 1991.\nDesign and Analysis of Routers and Network Architectures\nA high-throughput, low-latency communication network is essential to building a scalable, high perfor-\nmance multiprocessor. The network topology, switching mechanism, message routing algorithm, and ap-\nplication workload together determine performance of a network. While my research over the years has\nlooked into various aspects of designing high performance networks, I have speciﬁcally worked on devel-\noping efﬁcient routing algorithms for direct networks, evaluation of networks with realistic workloads, and\ndesigning faster routers/switches. We have developed partially and fully adaptive routing algorithms for\nhypercubes and meshes that require minimal number of virtual channels (VCs) to provide deadlock free-\ndom (no VC for partially adaptive routing in n-dimensional meshes [64] and 2 virtual channels for fully\nadaptive routing algorithm [66]). In addition, we have developed an analytical model to capture virtual\nchannel ﬂow control and routing adaptivity in hypercubes ([72]). Extension of these algorithms to handle\nlink and node faults in a network has also been proposed [73].\nWhile the research on network design and analysis is quite rich, very little work was done in evaluating\nnetworks with realistic workloads. The three communication attributes that are required for any network\nperformance study are the message inter-arrival time distribution with the corresponding generation rate,\nthe spatial distribution of messages or the trafﬁc pattern, and the message size (volume). Typical synthetic\nenvironments have assumed that the temporal distribution is exponential, the spatial distribution is uniform\nor a few localized communication patterns, and the message size is a ﬁxed number of bytes. While eval-\nuations with such synthetic workloads have been accused of providing inaccurate performance estimates,\nperformance evaluation with realistic workloads is quite complex and challenging. In this regard, we\n16\nhave initiated research on workload characterization of parallel applications and application-driven per-\nformance evaluation [78]. Using the temporal, spatial and volume attributes of communications, we have\nanalyzed the communication properties of shared memory and distributed memory applications. It has been\nshown that it is possible to quantify the temporal and spatial behavior of parallel applications using known\nmathematical distributions, which in turn can be used in application-driven performance evaluation. The\nimpact of performance enhancement features such as virtual channel ﬂow control and routing adaptivity\nwith realistic workloads has been analyzed ([29], [79]).\nDesign of fast routers is essential not only to build scalable interconnects, but also to enhance the perfor-\nmance of the entire system. We have developed a pipelined router architecture, called LAPSES (look-ahead\nrouting, intelligent path selection, and economic storage) that uses a minimal size routing table in support-\ning any routing algorithm in a regular network [86].\nResource Management in Multiprocessors\nPrudent management of system resources is essential to maximize the system throughput and utilization,\nwhile minimizing the average response time in a multi-user environment. Resource management in multi-\nprocessors is a well researched area. It consists of two steps; processor allocation and job scheduling. Pro-\ncessor allocation is concerned with allocating the parallel processes of a job to processors, while scheduling\ndecides the next job/process for execution. Both these techniques complement each other in maximizing\nthe delivered performance of a multiprocessor. Primarily contiguous allocation of processors to processes\nof a parallel job has been used to minimize the communication overhead, and thus improve the performance\nof closely-coupled multiprocessors. Since dynamic allocation is an NP-complete problem, a plethora of\nallocation algorithms for different multiprocessors have been proposed with varying degree of allocation\nability and complexity.\nWe have proposed efﬁcient processor allocation algorithms for hypercubes ([8], [46], [69]), MINs ([16]),\nand k-ary n-cubes/meshes ([25], [74], [80]). In particular, the free list policy [46], proposed for the hyper-\ncube multiprocessors, received the Daniel Slotnick Award for the best original paper at the 1989 Interna-\ntional Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP). An elegant scheduling algorithm, called lazy scheduling\nwas proposed ([17]) to boost the hypercube performance further.\nCluster systems\nCluster systems, also known as network of workstations/PCs (NOW), are becoming a predominant and\ncost-effective style for designing scalable, high performance computers. These systems are gaining ac-\nceptance not just in scientiﬁc applications but also in emerging commercial applications such as database\nservers and web servers. The tremendous surge in dynamic web contents, multimedia objects, e-commerce,\nand other web-enabled applications requires providing high performance and quality-of-service (QoS) sup-\nport in clusters.\nMy research on cluster systems has focused on three issues: design of high performance cluster inter-\nconnects, QoS provisioning in cluster interconnects, and scheduling techniques for clusters. In the area\nof high performance cluster interconnects, we have looked into the design of routers and network inter-\nfaces (NIs). We have set up a NOW laboratory to conduct various types of theoretical and experimental\nresearch. In particular, we are exploring the feasibility of providing QoS support in commercially success-\nful wormhole-switched routers. We have proposed a new wormhole router, called MediaWorm, that can\nsupport integrated trafﬁc in clusters ([32], [91]). Recently, we have proposed modiﬁcations to the industry\nstandard virtual interface architecture (VIA) to efﬁciently support real-time trafﬁc in the NI [95]. A num-\nber of interesting research issues involving hardware and software mechanisms to provide QoS support\nin routers, and modiﬁcations to user-level communication mechanisms for QoS provisioning are currently\nbeing investigated ([98], [100]).\nUnlike tightly-coupled multiprocessors, coscheduling of parallel processes in a loosely-coupled cluster\nis much more challenging because of the individual node autonomy, and relatively high communication\n17\noverhead. Therefore, a few other scheduling alternatives such as dynamic coscheduling (DCS) and implicit\ncoscheduling (ICS, SB) have been proposed in the literature. These schemes use the locally available mes-\nsage arrival information to schedule communicating processes of a job simultaneously. Using the user-level\ncommunication strategies such as U-Net, Fast Message, and VIA, they are shown to be quite efﬁcient. We\nhave proposed a design spectrum for implementing nine different coscheduling algorithms and in particu-\nlar have proposed an efﬁcient scheme, called periodic boost that is shown to be more efﬁcient on Solaris\nplatforms ([27], [87]). All these algorithms have been implemented on an UltraSPARC workstation cluster,\nconnected by Myrinet. This experimental testbed can be used for studying many scheduling alternatives.\nAny off-the-shelf MPI applications can run on this platform.\nSince the implementation of any prior coscheduling algorithm needs substantial effort, we have developed\na generic framework for implementing any coscheduling algorithm on a Linux cluster [116]. In addition,\nwe have proposed a new coscheduling, called Coordinated Coscheduling (CC), which has the potential to\noutperform all prior techniques [115]. This framework and the CC scheme has been implemented on a\nMyrinet connected 16-node Linux cluster on top of VIA and GM. Also, we have shown that it is possible\nto gain signiﬁcant performance beneﬁts by employing coscheduling algorithms on commercial platforms,\nwhich currently use various forms of batch scheduling. We are now porting the framework and the CC\nscheme to large Linux platforms to test with various scientiﬁc workloads. This experimental research is\nconducted in collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National laboratory (LLNL) and Penn State’s\nmain computing center.\nCurrent Research\nMy current work on cluster systems emphasizes on practical scheduling algorithms, QoS support in the\ncluster interconnects and NICs, and design of energy-efﬁcient interconnects. For the scheduling work,\nwe want to develop practical coscheduling algorithms that can provide better performance than the batch\nscheduling. The QoS support research is conducted in collaboration with Intel and other members of the\nInﬁniBand Trade Association (IBTA). Our simple congestion control technique ([105], [109]) is currently\nbeing examined by several IBTA members for inclusion in the IBA speciﬁcation. Clusters are now used\nfor designing data centers that include web servers, application servers and database servers. We are now\nexamining the impact of user-level communication and coscheduling algorithms on the performance of\ncluster-based data centers. In addition, energy consumption in clusters has become a serious concern due\nto their high power budgets. Also, the critical nature of many Internet-based services demand high server\navailability. Therefore, design of high performance, energy-efﬁcient, and dependable clusters has become\na pressing issue from socio-economic and environmental standpoints. In collaboration with our VLSI\ngroup, I have started design and analysis of energy-efﬁcient cluster interconnects [114]. In particular, we\nhave proposed a dynamic link shut down scheme, called DLS, to conserve energy. Compared to the prior\ndynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technique that incurs signiﬁcant performance penalty, the DLS scheme\ncan provide a better tradeoff between performance and power. We are also investigating the dependability\nimplications of energy-efﬁcient designs. Furthermore, I am expanding my research to network-on-chip\n(NoC) architectures to design SoC systems. Due to my inherent interest, I will attempt to develop per-\nformance and dependability models for such systems considering various practical limitations, and will\nconduct workload characterization of scientiﬁc and commercial applications for clusters.\nThe QoS ideas in the router have many similarities to the QoS concept in the Internet. I am currently\nsupervising two Ph.D. students on Internet QoS. We are developing a control theoretic approach to analyze\nand design various Active Queue management (AQM) schemes for Internet congestion control ([106],\n[107], [118], 119]). We have designed an AQM scheme, which can detect non-responsive TCP and UDP\nﬂows, and thus, can be used to dynamically quarantine such ﬂows [120]. Also, I am currently expanding my\nresearch to wireless/mobile/ad hoc systems. A Ph.D. student is examining the advantage of using caching\nfor combining ad hoc networks with the wired Internet for universal information accessibility ([112,117]).\n18\nMulticore/SoC Archietectures\nDesign and Analysis of data Centers\n19"
