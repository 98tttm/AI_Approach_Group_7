Seeking for the good opportunity\nbehavior of Samarium doped alkali lead boro-tellurite glasses.\nMethodology:  We adopted melting of the mixture method.\nAnalysis used: We used Luminescence, Radiative Parameters and Judd-\nOfelt Analysis.\nThe starting materials used in this study are of 99.9% purity.\nAfter mixing the reaction mixture is transferred to a porcelain crucible then it\nis fired for an hour at 950˚C in the furnace which leads to the formation of\nmolten flex.\nThen, it was poured on a hot copper plate maintains at temperature of 300˚C\nin another furnace and kept for 8 hours to enhance the mechanical strength\nand the quality of glass prepared.\nThe prepared glass samples were checked for the amorphous nature using X-\nRay powder diffraction technique.\nWe used FTIR method to determine the vibration spectra.\nThen, absorption spectra are determined using U-V Visible Spectrometer.\nTo find Optical absorption we used luminescence / Fluorescence\nSpectrophotometer.\nFrom this we have determined the physical properties such as Density,\nRefractive index, Rare earth ion concentration, polaron radius, inter ionic\ndistance, field strength, electronic polarizablity, molar refractivity, di-electric\nconstant, and reflection losses.\nConclusion:\nFinally the XRD pattern confirms amorphous nature of glass.\nFormula used:  K = 2hṕg/H²,Mass susceptibility = 2 hg/H²\nIn  this  we  have  adopted  Quincke’s  method  to  determine  the\nmagnetic susceptibility.\nHere we have taken liquid samples and we determined whether it is Dia,\nPara or Ferro magnet.\nPara magnetic substances are having positive susceptibility value\nand Diamagnetic substances are having negative susceptibility value, and\nFerromagnetic material is large positive value.\nDistrict\nIn this we studied ambience of schools & Emotional characters of School\nstudents in Dindigul District\nMethodology: Descriptive Survey Method\nFormula used: Mean, Standard Deviation, Test of Significance\nInitially we have selected 77 secondary students from two different schools.\nWe used stratified random sampling technique which will have more\nstatistical efficient.\nConclusion:\nIn  this  study,  the  investigator  has  attempted  to  study  the  Socio-\nemotional climate of schools. Since the role of the teacher is very important\nin shaping the personality of the student, it is always necessary to see that\nLike to accept challenges.\nFather’s Name             :   N.Kailasam\nDate of Birth                :   10-09-1990\nGender                         :   Female\nNationality                   :   Indian\nMailing Address            :   #7/7, Sri Raghavendra Flats,\nG-4, “Sai Sankalpa”,\nKuppusami Pillai Street,\nGuduvancheri – 603202.\nHobbies\nEngaging myself participating in Social services among the people who are\nat BPL (Below poverty line), Listening and Playing Music.\nYours Faithfully\n(K.MEENAKSHI)",
