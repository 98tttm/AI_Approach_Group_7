    "PROJECTS": "VEHICLE TRACKING AND LOCKING SYSTEM USING\nGPS & GSM\nVehicle tracking and locking system installed in the vehicle, to track the\nplace and locking engine motor. The place of the vehicle identified using\nGlobal Positioning system (GPS) and Global system mobile communication\n(GSM). When the theft identified, the responsible person send SMS to the\nmicrocontroller, then microcontroller issue the control signals to stop the\nengine motor. Authorized person need to send the password to controller to\nrestart the vehicle.\nOIL TEMPARATURE MEASUREMENT IN TRANSFORMER\nThe transformer oil is measured by using temperature sensor(LM35), and\noutput of the temperature sensor given as input to the ADC, whose output\ngiven as input to the microcontroller and output are displayed in LCD.\nTemperature depends on load current. Higher temperature can blast the\ntransformer. From this display indication we limit the load current in order\nto avoid bursting of transformer we need to maintain load current\nconstantly and if the temperature value increase beyond predefined value,\nit’s alerted by using an alarm circuit.\nADDITIONAL COURSES\n\nEMBEDDED training on Real Time Embedded System & Applications in RAANA POWER SOLUTIONS\n(Certified Course) 3-15 Feb 2014\nI learnt the basics of Real time embedded system and how it is implemented for applications by using\nsoftware’s like KEIL, PROTUS, ARDUINO.\n\nCompleted training for MOBILE SERVECING.\nI had been trained to service & replacing damaged mobile parts, soldering, disordering, cleaning mobiles\nusing ultrasonic wave cleaner.",
