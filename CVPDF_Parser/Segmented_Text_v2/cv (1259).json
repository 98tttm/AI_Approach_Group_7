    "ABOUT": "Jennifer So\nAddress\nPhone:\nEmail:\nSeptember 2nd, 2013\nPresident\nEE 400D Robot Company\n1250 Bellflower Blvd.\nLong Beach, CA 90840\nDear Mr. President,\nI am applying for the Manufacturing Line Manager position with the EE 400D Robot Company as\nadvertised on the company website.\nMy interest in Electrical Engineering grew when I started working with entertainment production\nequipment. I found myself increasingly drawn to understanding the science behind the technology, and\ndecided to pursue a career in Electrical Engineering.\nAs a Student Engineer Intern at The Boeing Company for a year and a half, I have had the opportunity\nto learn about 3D modeling on CATIA V5. Collaborating with a team of electrical engineers, I have\nworked on wiring design  for the raceway cabin, onboard networking systems, and lower lobes\nof various 7-series airplanes. In addition, I have also worked as an Engineer Assistant at LKK\nManufacturing, where I had the chance to learn about working with suppliers, logistics, and mechanics\nto put together efficient production schedules that meet sales and business needs.\nI would like to be a candidate for the Manufacturing Line Manager and 3D modeling positions, as my\nexperience in 3D modeling and managing the daily tasks of running a manufacturing plant is highly\napplicable for the position. Alternatively, I would like to be on the systems team. Given the chance, I\nwould like to work on the Prusa i3 dual extrusion head or the bio-printer .\nI look forward to hearing from you about the opportunity to join the EE 400D Robot Company.\nSincerely,\nJennifer So\nJENNIFER SO\nADDRESS\nPHONE: ∙ EMAIL:\nSeeking a Manufacturing Line Manager position at the EE 400D Robot Company.",
