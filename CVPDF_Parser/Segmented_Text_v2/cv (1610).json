First part was\ncontrolled by a normal user which gets permission by the cloud environment\nfor performing operations and for loading data. Second part was shown a\nsecure and trusted computing for the cloud. Along with this, the  also\nprovided two way security protocols which help both the normal user and the\ncloud. In this  we employ two algorithms for security purpose they are\nRSA and MD5.\nProgramming\nJava, Cloud computing, and Cryptography\nLanguage &\nPlatform\nTeam Size and\n10 and MATIO Software Solutions [Bangalore]\nClient\nDuration of\n10 Months (From Jan 2014 to Oct 2014)\nResponsibility\nDeveloped and Tested in Java Environment for Cloud-User Security Based\non RSA and MD5\nPage 3 of 7\nDeveloped Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) applets in JAVA CARD\n(JS_CUS_J015)\nIts object-oriented model allows smart card programmers to develop\nDescription\ninteroperable applets that can be deployed on smart cards independently\nof their manufacturer. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a branch of\npublic-key cryptography based on the arithmetic of elliptic curves. Java\nCard is a technology that has benefited from the success of the Java\nlanguage.\nWe developed this  for implementing ECC applications in smart\ncards will be an attractive option for many companies willing to create\nnew security services.\nProgramming\nJava and Cryptography\nLanguage &\nPlatform\nTeam Size and\n10 and MATIO Software Solutions [Bangalore]\nClient\n10 Months (From Nov 2014 to Aug 2015)\nResponsibility\nDeveloped and Tested in Java for ECC\nDeveloped and deployed a High Speed Algorithm for Identifying Hand\nGestures for ATM Input System for the Blind (JS_CUS_J016)\nDescription\nWith the evolution in science and technology, a lot has been done over\nthe past few years to make the lives of the Differently-abled more\ncomfortable and easy. This  concentrates on a novel\nmethodology to ease the use of an ATM machine for the blind. It\ndescribes an approach wherein both the\nUser-name and PIN for the ATM machine can be input using British\nSign Language. A cost effective setup and also a high speed algorithm\nfor hand gesture recognition has been elaborated. In comparison with\nprevious algorithms, the method explained in this  is 1.65 times\nfaster thus proving its efficacy and efficiency. All algorithms were first\ndesigned and\ndeveloped in MATLAB 2011b and then later deployed as software\nusing the Java programming language\nProgramming\nJAVA\nLanguage & Platform\nTeam Size and Client\n10 and MATIO Software Solutions [Bangalore]\n10 Months (From Sep 2015 to June 2016)\nResponsibility\nDeveloped and Tested in Java\nPage 4 of 7\nDeveloped Java based Computer Algebra System for Symbolic Computing\n(JS_CUS_J017)\nDescription\nTo solve complex and large mathematical expression manually using pen\nand paper is a time taking task which in most cases ends up in an erroneous\nresult. This is a major drawback which may lead to heavy losses to people\ndealing in numbers.\nHenceforth we have come up with a vision of Symbolic\ncomputation which provides a quick, efficient and user friendly\nenvironment to its users. Symbolic Computation is a computer algebra\nsystem which has been designed in Java. The Object oriented\nProgramming(OOP) concept and predefined packages of the language have\nbeen used to solve expressions consisting of differentiation, integration,\nseries and many more symbols.\nProgramming\nJava/ Mathematical Pseudo Language (MPL)\nLanguage &\nPlatform\nTeam Size and\n10 and MATIOTL Software Solutions [Bangalore]\nClient\nDuration of\n09 Months (From July 2016 to March 2017)\nResponsibility\nDeveloped and Tested in Java\nFinal Year :\n“Mining of high utility item-sets using Transactional Database”\nDescription\nIn this  front-end based up on ASP.Net and the back-end\ndepends on MS-Excel. The main objective of this  is to\nidentify high utility candidate item-sets by efficient algorithms.\nBased on UP (Utility Pattern) growth and UP Growth+\nalgorithms high utility item-sets was effectively constructed.\nThese algorithms reduce the space requirement and execution\ntime by generating UP-Tree. The transactional database was used\nfor working with large candidate item-sets it reduces runtime of\nlong transactions.\nProgramming Language &\nASP.Net, MS-Excel, UP (Utility Pattern) growth and UP\nPlatform\nGrowth+ algorithms\nTeam Size and Client\n04 and BITs, Erode\n07 Months\nResponsibility\nTaken care the System design, Coding, Testing & Documentation\nPage 5 of 7\n“Criminal Face Identification System (CFIS)”\nDescription\nIn this  front-end based up on Java7 and the back-end depended on\nOracle10g. The main objective of this  was identifying criminal face\nby eyewitness. Based on this the image was segmented using Mathlab tool\nfor correct assurance. One of the criteria among detecting criminal face was\nthe segments of face image must match with existing image.
