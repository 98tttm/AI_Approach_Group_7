There are so many who can easily\nhack the private or secure conversation or data so it is necessary to make the data secure for transmission. A\nspy communication system deals with that all. It uses encrptography and steganography to make the data\nsecure. In encryptography the meaningful data is used to be converted in a ciphertext using a pseudo random\nkey which only can be reconstructed into meaningful message using decryption process using the same key\nused by the sender of the message whereas in steganography the data used to be hidden behind some image\nfile or mp3 or video.So using both the method together the data can be made more secure and undetectable\nfor the transmission specially a private or scientific conversation.\nTeam Size: 4\nDeclaration:\nI hereby declare that all the information furnished above is true to the best of my knowledge.\nPlace:\nYours sincerely,\nDate:\n[ADRIAN ELLIOTT]",
