The main objective of this  is to help for physically disabled persons\nspecifically those who are unable to walk.\nCoirfed system is used to develop the small scale coir production to large scale production. In this  we\nare dealing with the stock entry details of various products,salary details of labours and details of wholesale dealers\netc. In the existing system we have done it by manual and it is time consuming. In the proposed system we have done\nit by computer so the data entry and accessing the details of labour and products will be more accurate and easier.\nSEMINARS AND PRESENTATIONS\nPresented seminar on the curriculam section entitled as “VIRTUAL REALITY APPLICATIONS” :",
