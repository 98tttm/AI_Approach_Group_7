    "PROJECTS": "P\nDIRECTOR, INFORMATION SYSTEMS PACS ADMINISTRATOR/IS SYSTEMS ANALYST\nIn addition to successfully developing and mentoring an exceptional IS team of 6 during my two years in this position, we implemented the first\nthree phases of Electronic Medical Record through the hospital and owned physician offices, completed a new data center implementation,\nconversion to fiber backbone communications and digital phone system, Windows 7 upgrade for over 800 users and total systems upgrades in the\nclinical departments. This facility was shifted to a higher level within the CHS network of 250 hospitals and awarded numerous national accolades\nfrom third-parties due to some of the changes made by my department and team. I was brought into South Baldwin Regional Medical Center as\nthe facility's first IS-based PACS Administrator. After initial reorganization of the PACS environment and creation of PACS related support\ncoordination, fileserver redesign for more stable and productive use, network and system optimizations where needed to improve efficiency,\noutlying clinic improvements to encourage \"single-company\" relations, and a number of others where needed.

The three week onsite implementation of the ImageLink system entailed; coordinating server placement and\nnetworking with hospital IT, directing the installation of all server and reading hardware, coordination with all modality vendors to establish\nDICOM communication with the new system, integration with CPSI and other vendor HIS, Radiologist and staff training and conversion of data\nfrom the previous Radiology system. A number of these sites requested that we perform the conversion of data without involving the previous\nvendor. Success in these situations required developing an in-depth familiarity with numerous systems, including: McKesson, GE Centricity, Philips\niSite, OrthoView, E-Film and Spectra PACS systems. Because responsibilities included development planning with Programming and travel with\nSales to assist in promoting the ImageLink product, I acquired additional familiarity with these competitor systems in order to keep ImageLink\ncurrent with the needs of our customers and provide my employees with training relevant to their implementations. This broad spectrum of\ninvolvement with multiple PACS systems left me knowledgeable on their use, tools and configuration. CPSI of Mobile In September 2006,\nImageLink was in use at 27 of CPSI's 950 hospitals nationwide.
