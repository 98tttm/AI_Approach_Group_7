At the same time it is may be easier to modify and misuse the valuable\ninformation  through  hacking. Reversible  data  hiding  (RDH)  in  encrypted  images\namplified  to  50kW  peak  power  in  the  transmitter  and  is  fed  to  the  antenna.  This\nelectromagnetic energy is radiated into space by antenna array. The backscattered signal from\nthe irregularities are passed through a coherent receiver where the signal is phase detected\nusing two reference signals having quadrature phase relationship. The in phase and quadrature\nphase outputs of the two phase detectors (sine and cosine channels) have all the information\ncontained in the backscattered received signal. As a part of augmentation, the receiver system\nof the HF radar to a state-of-the-art Digital Receiver using FPGA technology is to be carried\nout.\nVersatile\n\n\nOptimistic\n\nHardworking & Ability to work in a team\n\nOffice Package: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Microsoft\n\nPowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook Express\nLanguages: VHDL ,C.\n\nFPGA Development (Altera, Xilinx)\n\nAnalog Development: Resolver-to-Digital Converters, A/D Converters, D/A\n\nConverters",
