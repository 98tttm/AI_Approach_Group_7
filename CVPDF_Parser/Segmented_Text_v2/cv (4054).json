It presents a design of a low-cost; high-efficiency drive capable of supplying\na single-phase a.c induction motor with a PWM modulated sinusoidal voltage . The circuit\noperation is controlled by an microcontroller. The device is aimed at substituting the\ncommonly used triac phase angle control drives.\nThe drive uses a PWM controlled MOSFET and the load in series with a bridge rectifier. This\ndrive based on this new control technique is targeted for use in consumer and industrial\nproducts: washing machine, dishwashers, ventilators, compressors, and wherever the system\ncost is a consideration.\nIndustrial Training:\n45 days Summer  Training  from  N.T.P.C.(National  Thermal\n\n\nMatlab Simulation\n\nProfessional Qualification:\nExam Details\nCollege/University\nYear Of Passing\ndivision\n1st\nB.TECH(EEE\nM.D.U(HARYANA)\n2012\nENGG)\nAcademic Qualification:\nExam Details\nCollege/University\nYear Of Passing\nDivison",
