Ms. Naumburg managed and budgeted tasks,\npersonnel. She designed experiments and supervised staff in\nvegetation data collection, collected and analyzed vegetation\ndynamics data in relation to groundwater levels, and authored\nmanuscripts, reports and presentations. She further parameterized\nand assisted with EDYS updates, a landscape-level ecological model.\n2003 - 2005\nPostdoctoral Research Assistant, University of Nevada, Las\nVegas. Analyzed environmental and physiological factors affecting\nphotosynthesis in desert shrubs under ambient and elevated CO2 to\ndevelop seasonal gas exchange model.
