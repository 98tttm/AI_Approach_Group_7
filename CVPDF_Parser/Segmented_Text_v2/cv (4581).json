    "ABOUT": "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COORDINATOR\nB.S. graduate with a record of success implementing IT solutions. Demonstrated commitment to quality and customer service, detail oriented,",
    "PROJECTS": "approving high-level and detail designs, as well as managing successful test plans. Directed all stages of software development including\nrequirements, design, coding, testing and implementation of several company wide Intranet initiatives like Ovations! - An associate rewards and\nrecognition program used by over 30,000 employees; Kronos TM Workforce Central - a time and attendance program for 13,000 non-exempts\nSQL Server 6.5,7, 2000 and 2005, My SQL, and Oracle 9i. Proficient with MS Windows, MS Office, Minitab, Business Objects, Adobe CS3\nCompany Name As webmaster I was responsible for the wing-to-wing implementation of online solutions for small businesses using the full System\ndesign specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design/develop/testing phases, the implementing of database systems\nusing Classic ASP/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux\nASP.Net/MS SQL 2005 solutions implemented during this period were vendor developed ad tracking and e-mail newsletter marketing software.\nClients relied upon the research and cost benefit analysis provided to determine the best solution that met their needs and budget.\nIntranet Application Support Analyst Jan 2003 to Jul 2007\nCompany Name Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private\nimplementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives\nsuch as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface\nteams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i\ninfrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production\nenvironment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the\nsystem to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99%\ncompliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and\napproval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within\nthe scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run\nteam was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing\nmaintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow\nfor a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management\nLeadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which\nI filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus\non and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague.\nImplemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure\nof the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to\ncompleted within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10\n- 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of\nDevelopment, Closer, Media Strategy, Networking, Online Marketing, Bank Card, Collections, Credit, Data Migration, Receivables, Intranet,\nMaintenance, Application Support, Archiving, Data Management, Subject Matter Expert, Work Flow, Business Requirements, Engineer, Finance,\nGraphical User Interface, Increase, Kronos, Load Balancing, Offshore, Oracle, Payroll, Production Environment, User Interface, Belt Certified,\nBlack Belt, Six Sigma, Six-sigma, .net, Associate, Client/server, Coding, Css, Customer Service, Database Management, Detail Oriented, Dhtml,\nReceptionist, Retail Sales, Self Motivated, Software Development, Structured Software, Team Player, Test Plans, Time & Attendance, Time And\nAttendance, Visual Studio, Xml",
