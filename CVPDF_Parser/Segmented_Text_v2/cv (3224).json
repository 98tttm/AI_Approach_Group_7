Pelton turbine is most efficient at this\ncondition. Thus, more power power can be extracted from a water source with high\npressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure and high flow, even\nwhen the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made in\nall sizes.\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING\n1.\nBharat  Heavy  Electricals  Limited  Haridwar:  BHEL  is  the  largest\nengineering  and  manufacturing  enterprise  in  India  in  the  energy  related\nGenerators, and Heat Exchangers etc.\n2.\nGSA Metals: GSA Metals is the engineering and manufacturing enterprise in\nIndia in the automobile sector today.
