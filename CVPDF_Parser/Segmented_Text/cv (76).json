There are so many who can easily\nhack the private or secure conversation or data so it is necessary to make the data secure for transmission. A\nspy communication system deals with that all. It uses encrptography and steganography to make the data\nsecure. In encryptography the meaningful data is used to be converted in a ciphertext using a pseudo random\nkey which only can be reconstructed into meaningful message using decryption process using the same key\nused by the sender of the message whereas in steganography the data used to be hidden behind some image\nfile or mp3 or video.So using both the method together the data can be made more secure and undetectable\nfor the transmission specially a private or scientific conversation.\nTeam Size: 4\n \nDeclaration:\nI hereby declare that all the information furnished above is true to the best of my knowledge.\nPlace: \nYours sincerely,\n \nDate: \n [ADRIAN ELLIOTT]", "ACTIVITIES": ":\n\nPresented a Seminar Report on Plasma Display. \n\nParticipate in roborace in college technical function.", "PROJECTS": ":-\n\nInvolved in IN-STP and IN-PACO link integration/De-integration/configuration.\n\nZero defect operation.\n\nIN PCN to APCN changes.\n\nSubscribers Profile/product changes related to GST.\n\nApply various patches/debugs/FTPs to fix/debug the issues and to improve system performance.\n\nInvolved in various recons related to charging issues.\n\nInvolved in Power", "EDUCATION": ": \n B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 2013 from APOLLO INSTITUTE OF\nTECHNOLOGY affiliated to GBTU (Formely UPTU) University.\n \n Intermediate 2009 from S.I.College (State Board, U.P )\n High School 2007 from S.I.College(State Board,U.P)", "CERTIFICATIONS": "RHCSA ( Red had certified system Admin) RHEL 7\nRHCE (Red hat certified Engineer) RHEL 7\nArea of interest\n\nMobile Communication and GSM System.\n\nData Communication Network\n\nSignal and System.\nSoftware", "SKILLS": ":\nPlatform : Windows xp, 7,8,8.1.\n Packages known : Electronics-Embedded System\nTraining and Internship:\n\nCompleted one month training on embedded system from BRICS .\n\nCompleted one month training on GSM system and Architecture from AIRCEL. \nExtra Curricular"}}
