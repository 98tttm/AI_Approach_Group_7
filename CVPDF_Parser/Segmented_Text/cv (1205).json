He is a member of the\nSistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican System for Researching); of the Academic Group\nScience and Engineering of Nanomaterials since 2015, after being member of the gropu\nSynthesis and Characterization of Materials since 2003 (PROMEP) at FIME, member de la\nUANL; and of the Mexican Academy of Sciences. He has participated in 2009 and 2011 in the\nChair of Mexican Studies at the Universit de Toulouse, Le Mirail. He earned the Research\nAward UANL in 1991 for the work \"Development of a topochemical model of reduction of iron\nore. As part of a team he earned the same award in 2001 for the work \"Effect of iron over the\nsintering, order parameter and morphology of a spinel of the system Al 2O3-MgO-Fe2O3\"; in\n2003 (granted in 2004) for the work \"Synthesis of MgAl2O4 at low temperatures with additions\nof CaCO3\"; and in 2012 for the work Design of slips for producing ultrathin ceramic tapes for\ncapacitors by tape casting. In 2000 he earned with a team, the TECNOS Award of Technology\nfor the work \"Iron oxide layer formation over the walls of direct reduction ore reactors\".\nDr. AGUILAR-GARIB is the Head Editor of Revista Ingenieras of FIME and the Editor in\nChief of the Journal of Microwave Power and Electromagnetic Energy.\nThe interest areas of Dr. AGUILAR-GARIB consider application of technology for\noptimization of processes, decision making supported by scientific foundations, considering\nenergetic and environmental aspects, with novel technologies for supplying energy to the\nprocesses and development of know-how, based on scientific aspects, applied to materials\nprocessing.\nhttp://grafito.fime.uanl.mx/"}}
