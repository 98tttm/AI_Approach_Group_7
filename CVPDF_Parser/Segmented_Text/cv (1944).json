{"id": "cv (1944).pdf", "sections": {"PROJECT": "we are using microcontroller. \n- \nIt has a timer part which is used to use to change the timings of the motor. \nWorking principle: \n- \nInitially it will drain out the water from first bore well. Once present water was drained out it \nwill change into another bore well. \n- \nIf the water has drained with fixed time it will change automatically to next bore well. \n- \nAlso we can change the timings based on availability of water. \nAdvantages: \n- \nIncreasing the efficiency of the motor. \n- \nReducing wastage of the electric power. \n- \nAvoiding of dry run condition of the motor and increase the draining water level. \n- \nReducing the man power in operations. \n \nEDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATION: \n \nCompleted Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (BE-EEE) \nwith 70% in Sri Eshwar college of Engineering in 2013 batch. \n \nComputer knowledge: \n PCB designing software. \n Windows 7 and 8 operating systems. \n MS office outlook. \n \nPERSONAL DETAILS: \nDate of Birth : 05-11-1991 \nLanguages known: English, Tamil, Moderate Hindi read and write. \nNative \n : Udumalpet(Tk),Tiruppur. \nMarital status : Single \n \n \n \nDeclaration: \n \nI hereby declare that the above written particulars are true to the best of my knowledge and \nbelief. \n \n Date: \nPlace: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRAMPRASATH.T", "ABOUT": "the company details, duration, salary, negotiations, etc. \n \n \nCompany Name: PRS INDUSTRIES, Chennai. \nPosition : Electrical Maintenance Engineer \nDuration \n : Sep 2015-Nov 2016 \n \n \nRoles and responsibilities: \n- \nMaintaining the electrical equipments in the company. \n- \nProvide engineering support by responding to request for electrical and mechanical problems. \n- \nKeeps equipment operating by following operating instructions. \n- \nTroubleshooting breakdowns and recovering those issues. \n- \nStrong knowledge in electrical motor starters. \n- \nMaintain perfect power supplies and performing preventive maintenance."}}
