Higher temperature can blast the \ntransformer. From this display indication we limit the load current in order \nto avoid bursting of transformer we need to maintain load current \nconstantly and if the temperature value increase beyond predefined value, \nits alerted by using an alarm circuit. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nEXTRA CURRICULAR", "SKILLS": "OBTAINED \nCORE COMPETENCIES \nOBJECTIVE", "EDUCATION": ". \n \n \n \n \nLanguages: English, Tamil. \n \nInterests: Playing cricket and carrom. \n \n \n \nI hereby declare that all the above furnished information are true to the best of my knowledge and also that \ni shall render my service to your fullest satisfaction and expectation. \n \n \n JEBIS MEJO.H \n \n \n \nDIPLOMA", "PROJECTS": "pvt ltd, Chennai from June 2016 to Dec 2016. \n \n \n \n \nEvent organizer in national level technical symposium. \n \nActive scout participant in school. \n \nMember in Indian society for technical", "ACTIVITIES": "DECLARATION\nADDITIONAL COURSES \nPAPER PRESENTATIONWORKSHOPS/INDUSTRIAL VISIT\nEXPERIANCE"}}
