Pelton turbine is most efficient at this \ncondition. Thus, more power power can be extracted from a water source with high \npressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure and high flow, even \nwhen the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made in\nall sizes.\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING\n1.\nBharat Heavy Electricals Limited Haridwar: BHEL is the largest\nengineering and manufacturing enterprise in India in the energy related\ninfrastructure sector today.
