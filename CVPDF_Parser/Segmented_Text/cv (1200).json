I am writing to apply for the \nposition.\nI understand that McDuff is making a major effort to build a full-scale equipment \ndevelopment laboratory. That prospect interests me greatly, because of my academic background in \nelectrical engineering. At CSULB, I took courses in several subjects that might be useful in the labs\nwork  for example, microprocessor applications, artificial intelligence, and fiber optics.\nAlso, related work at Jones Energy & Automation, Inc. has given me experience building \nand developing new electronics systems. In particular, my work as an assembler taught me the \nimportance of precision and quality control. I would like the opportunity to apply this knowledge at \nMcDuff.\nEnclosed is my rsum, which focuses on the", "SKILLS": ":\nFluent in English and Korean.\nEXPERIENCE:\n2009  Present.
