It was observed that the\nmaximum strength value was obtained during optimum input parameter setting, In this relation \nthere are different Mechanical Testings are carried out such as Tensile Test, Impact and Izod \nTest, Hardness Test, Bending Test, Microstructure Analysis which results give Higher Integrity\nof Welded joints and the breakdown of metals carried on outside portion of the Welded Zone\nDuration : Six Months\nRole\n: Team Lead\nTeam Size : 4\n\nOil and Gas (Operations and Maintenance, Mechanical Static and Rotating Equipment's)\n\nMechanical Site Engineering (HVAC, MEP)\n\nProduction and Manufacturing (Design, Shop floor Machining Operations, Quality Control, Assembly,\nInspection, Calibration Material handlings, Documentation, Dispatch)\n\nManagement (Planning, Organising, Controlling, QMS, QC Tools, Six Sigma, ISO, Agile Manufacturing)\n\nMicrosoft Office Word, Excel, Powerpoint\n\nMaintenance Strategies (RCA, RCM, CMMS, SAP Condition Monitoring)\n\nDesign Tools and Softwares Autocad, Solidworks and Ansys\n\nGood oral and written communication", "PROJECT": "DETAILS\nAREA OF SPECIALIZATION"}}
