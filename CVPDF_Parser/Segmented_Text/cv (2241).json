The Indian power market has \ntransitioned from a sheltered structure, with limited players, to a dynamic and vibrant \nmarket with a large number of players and rapidly rising volumes. This has happened in a \nrelatively short span of time, particularly after the Electricity Act of 2003 gave the \nnecessary impetus. The Act recognized power trading as a distinct activity due to which \nshort-term traded volumes and the number of market participants have been on a rise. \n \n \n \nACADEMIC PROFILE", "EDUCATION": "Council,Patna \nMatriculation \nPCM \nBihar School \n2003 \n74.1% \nExamination \nBoard,Patna \n \nTECHANICAL", "ACTIVITIES": "at graduateandpostgraduatelevel. \n Organised various college events and acted as executive manager in inter college \nfesting raduation. \n \n \nDECLARATION \n \nI here by certify that all the information provided here is correct to the best \nof my knowledge and belief. \n \n \nABHISHEK KR.
