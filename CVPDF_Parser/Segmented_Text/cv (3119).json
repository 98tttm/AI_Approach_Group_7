Flywheels resist changes in rotational speed by their moment of\ninertia. The amount of energy stored in a flywheel is proportional to the square of\nits rotational speed. The way to change a flywheel stored energy is by increasing or\ndecreasing its rotational speed applying a torque aligned with its axis of symmetry.\nACHIEVEMENTS / CO-CURRICULAR", "ACTIVITIES": ":\nAuto CAD And Pro/E Certificate.\nBharat Vikash Parishad Certificate.\nINPLANT TRAINING / INDUSTRIAL VISIT:\nANIL SPECIAL STEEL INDUSTRIES LTD JAIPUR 1 JUNE 2013 TO 30 JUNE 2013\nPERSONAL PROFILE:\nFathers Name\n:Ram Chandra Bairwa\nDate of Birth \n: 05th April 1990\nGender \n: Male \nPassport Number\n: M4017503\nLanguage Known \n: English And Hindi\n Hobbies \n: Singing Songs,Listening Music,Reading Books,Social\n \nServices.\nAddress \n: 186,Anantwada Ka Gola, Bairwa Ki Dhani,Post-\n \n \n \n \nAnantwada,Via-Bandikui,Tehsil-Baswa,District-\nDausa,Rajasthan,India-303313.\nDECLARATION:\nI hereby declare that the above particulars furnished by me are true to the best of my knowledge\nand belief. \nDate:25th July 2017\nPlace: Jaipur \n Bhagwan Sahay Bairwa"}}
