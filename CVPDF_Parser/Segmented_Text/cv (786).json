{"id": "cv (786).pdf", "sections": {"PROJECTS": "already underway to build three\ndimensional graphical visualization tools which interoperate with the Web. Attendees\nagreed on the need for these tools to have a common language for specifying 3D scene\ndescription and WWW hyperlinks -- an analog of HTML for virtual reality. The term\nVirtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) was coined, and the group resolved to begin\nspecification work after the conference. The word Markupwas later changed to\nModelingto reflect the graphical nature of VRML.\nAPPROVED\nShortly after the Geneva BOF session, the www-vrml mailing list was created to discuss\nthe development of a specification for the first version of VRML. The response to the list\ninvitation was overwhelming: within a week, there were over a thousand members. After\nan initial settling-in period, list moderator Mark Pesce of Labyrinth Group announced his\nintention to have a draft version of the specification ready by the WWW Fall 1994\nconference, a mere five months away. There was general agreement on the list that, while\nthis schedule was aggressive, it was achievable provided that the requirements for the\nfirst version were not too ambitious and that VRML could be adapted from an existing\nsolution. The list quickly agreed upon a set of requirements for the first version, and\nbegan a search for technologies which could be adapted to fit the needs of VRML.\nThe search for existing technologies turned up a several worthwhile candidates. After\nmuch deliberation the list came to a consensus: the Open Inventor ASCII File Format\nfrom Silicon Graphics, Inc. The Inventor File Format supports complete descriptions of\n3D scenes with polygonally rendered objects, lighting, materials, ambient properties and\nrealism effects. A subset of the Inventor File Format, with extensions to support\nnetworking, forms the basis of VRML. Gavin Bell of Silicon Graphics has adapted the\nInventor File Format for VRML, with design input from the mailing list. SGI has publicly\nstated that the file format is available for use in the open market, and have contributed a\nfile format parser into the public domain to bootstrap VRML viewer development.\nAPPROVED\nA Graphical Representation of Inverse VRML Uptake\nChange the number in red below to adjust for download rate and/or bandwidth.\n1\nThe number 1 represents an engineer with an \"average\" cube *\nCF\nMin\nfsw\nAir\nEANx\n32%\nEANx\n36%\n80.0 149.12\n0\n61.4 114.43\n10\n49.8 92.846\n20\n41.9 78.102\n30\n180\n36.2 67.402\n40\n120\n31.8 59.275\n50\n80.0\n147.0\n192.0\n28.4\n52.9\n60\n57.0\n92.0\n123.0\n25.6 47.774\n70\n40.0\n65.0\n79.0\n23.4 43.543\n80\n30.0\n49.0\n59.0\n21.5 40.001\n90\n24.0\n37.0\n45.0\n19.9\n37\n100\n19.0\n30.0\n35.0\n18.5 34.409\n110\n16.0\n25.0\n29.0\n17.3 32.154\n120\n13.0\n20.0\nn/a\n16.2 30.178\n130\n10.0\n17.0\nn/a\n15.1 28.202\n140\n8.0\nn/a\nn/a\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\nDays after download\nInverse usage\nProgrammers\nTechnical Writers\nQA\nOther\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\nDays after download\nInverse log usage\nArtists\nMusicians\nPoliticians\nDentists"}}
