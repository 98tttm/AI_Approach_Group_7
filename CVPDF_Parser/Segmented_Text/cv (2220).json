Recent trends in the power generation\nand distribution systems show that penetration level of DG into the grid has \nincreased considerably.\nEnd users appliances are becoming more sensitive to the power quality \nconditions. Extensive research on facts devices for the mitigation of PQ problems\nare also carried out. Facts devices are found to be very capable in integrating \nsolar and wind energy sources to the grid.\nSeveral FACTS devices have been introduced for various applications \nworldwide. A number of new types of devices are in the stage of being \nintroduced in practice. Even more concepts of configuration of FACTS devices \nare discussed in research and literature.\nIn most of the applications the controllability is used to avoid cost intensive or \nSuccessfully coordinated Embedded\n \n Linux\n \n and\n \n Device\n \n Drivers\n \n , two day workshop \nby Emb Logic Embedded Technologies Pvt.
