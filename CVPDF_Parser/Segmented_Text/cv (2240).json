If you run out of space, visit https://www.dropbox.com/plans to view our available sub-\nscriptions.\nHow much space does my Dropbox have?\nFree accounts come with 2GB of space (deleted les and revisions wont count against your limit). You \ncan always check your usage by visiting your account settings page at https://www.dropbox.com/ac-\ncount. \nHow long until my les are fully synced?\nDropbox will download as fast or as slow as your network allows, and will try its best to not hog your \nconnection. If youd like to limit your upload or download rates, you can change them in Dropboxs pref-\nerences. For step by step instructions, visit the help article at https://www.dropbox.com/help/26.\nDropbox is fast! How could it have possibly synced all of my les in that time?\nDropbox will look to see if it already has the le youre trying to upload. If it senses that it already has the \nfile, it wont bother to upload it again. If the le has been changed recently, it will only upload/download \nthe changes rather than the whole thing.\nHow secure is Dropbox?\nDropbox takes the security of your files and of our software very seriously. Dropbox uses Secure Socket \nLayer (SSL) and AES-256 encryption. AES-256 is the same encryption standard used by banks to secure \ncustomer data.\nCan I access Dropbox on my mobile device?\nThe Dropbox App is available for iPhone, iPad, Android, and Blackberry. To install Dropbox on your \nmobile device, visit http://www.dropbox.com/mobile. You can also get to your Dropbox at any time by \nvisiting http://www.dropbox.com from your phone."}}
