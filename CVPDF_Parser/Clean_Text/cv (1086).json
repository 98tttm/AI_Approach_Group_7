I desire to further research and development in the field of machine vision \nand Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). \n \nMy journey into electrical engineering started when I was 12 years old and my uncle taught me how to solder so \nI could fix my guitar cable. When he saw my eagerness to learn he proceeded to make me a kit of various \ncomponents and supply me with some basic project instructions. Ever since then I have been hooked. As a kid I \nwould take apart electronic devices to see how they worked, build electronics kits from MarVac Electronics and \nexperiment by circuit bending all types of battery powered toys. \n \nOver the summer I worked on a project for a promising up-and-coming company in product development. I \ntook on the task of developing an Android Application for remote control, via Bluetooth, of a robotic toy. While \nI did not have prior experience in application development, I had taken on the challenge and sought out various \nresources to get the job done. I also had the chance to take on jobs outside the scope of electrical engineering. \nThis includes troubleshooting construction and graphic design elements for the products exterior. The \nexperience as a whole has piqued my interest in User Experience Design (UXD), and product development \noverall. \n \nIn the near future I see myself working my way up to division manager. I feel that my interpersonal skills that I \nhave developed while working as an Instructional Aide for the Severely Handicapped and Interpreter for the \nDeaf and Hard of Hearing are invaluable. I have extensive knowledge in working with large groups of people as \nwell as facilitating communication between individuals of varying backgrounds and intellectual abilities. Also, \ngiven my work in the education field, I am well-versed in data collection and making recommendations that are \nbacked-up with adequate information. \n \nGiven the opportunity, I would enjoy the chance to develop my 3D modeling/printing and printed circuit board \ndesign/fabrication skills during my time at The Robot Company. I also look forward to the opportunity of \nattending any and all workshops offered to make myself a well-rounded engineer. I am a lifelong learner who is \nalways looking to explore new fields of knowledge. I would also enjoy working with your experienced \nengineers Nicholas Lombardo and Nick Vuono. \n \nIf you have any questions feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing back from you about the \nopportunities at The Robot Company. \n \n \nSincerely, \nLawrence Swift \n \n \n \nLawrence Swift \n1234 My Drive, Huntington Beach, CA 92646  (714) 555-7506  Lawrence.Swift.US@IEEE.org \nPresident of IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu, Epsilon Theta Chapter (2015-2016 Academic Year) \nSummary \nSeeking a position in the Mission Control Console Group to help research, develop and implement \nmachine vision and SLAM technology for robotic applications. \n \nProgramming Languages: Assembly, C++, Java, VHDL \n \nSoftware/Development Environments: Android Studio, AVR Studio, CadSoft Eagle PCB Design, \nEclipse, ISE Design Suite, LTSpice, MATLAB, Microsoft Office, Simulink, Solidworks \n \nStandard Lab Test Equipment: Function Generator, Mulitmeter, Oscilloscope, Power Supply \nEducation \nBachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering \nExpected Fall 2016 \nCalifornia State University, Long Beach \n \n3.75 GPA for EE courses, 3.36 GPA cumulative \n \nAssociate in Science- Mathematics \nFall 2012 \nOrange Coast College, Costa Mesa, California \n \nProjects \n3D Printer BUILD Series \nSpring 2015 \nRepRap Prusa i3 build workshop \n \nPaperBot \nMay 2015 to Present \nAndroid Application development, toy construction and graphic design, SMD \nstencil documentation and layout \n \nEmployment \nInstructional Aide- Severely Handicapped/Interpreter for the Deaf, \nHuntington Beach Union High School District, Huntington Beach, CA \n2007 to Present \n \nAssist students in the set-up and use of speech-generating devices. \n \nObserve and document progress of students to then confer with teachers. \n \nProfessionally communicate with parents, interdepartmental staff, and district \noffice employees through written and verbal means. \n \nMaintaining legal forms pertaining to students, staff, and school site issues. \n \nCo-manager, Digi-Photo, Huntington Beach, CA \n2005 to 2007 \n \nDevelop professional relationships with customers to promote repeat sales. \n \nResponsible for setting lab standards of quality, timeliness and efficiency. \n \nMaintain clean, neat and organized work areas. \n \nSocieties and Organizations \nIEEE, CSULB Student Chapter \nFall 2013 to Present \nIEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), Epsilon Theta Chapter \nCorresponding Secretary: 2014-2015 Academic Year \nFall 2013 to Present \nTau Beta Pi, California Theta Chapter \nChair of Recruitment: 2015 Spring Semester \nFall 2014 to Present"}
