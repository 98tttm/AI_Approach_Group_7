Only those who possess a\nsecret key can decipher the message into plain text. Encrypted\nmessages can sometimes be broken by cryptanalysis, also called\ncodebreaking, although modern cryptography techniques are\nvirtually unbreakable .As the Internet and other forms of electronic\ncommunication become more prevalent, electronic security is\nbecoming increasingly important. Cryptography is used to protect e-\nmail messages, credit card information, and corporate data. One of\nthe most popular cryptography systems used on the Internet is Pretty\nGood Privacy because it's effective and free. \nThis project is based on this onsymmetric key cryptography. An\nencryption system in which the sender and receiver of a message\nshare a single, common key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the\nmessage. Symmetric-key systems are simpler and faster, but their\nmain drawback is that the two parties must somehow exchange the\nkey in a secure way.\nSkills:\nMANUAL TESTING\nA budding professional with extensive conceptual knowledge in Software Testing\nDemonstrated exposure in full life-cycle implementations with skills in executing \nSoftware Development life cycle (SDLC) & different Models of SDLC\n \nGood knowledge on STLC, Manual Testing, Types of testing,\nDecent information of Build, Re-spin, Release\nGood knowledge on writing Test Case, Test plan, Reviewing Process.\nKnowledge on Defect, Defect cycle\nGood knowledge on Defect Tracking Tool  Bugzilla\nTraining Attended : \nTejas TSSC Certification Program in Telecom Technology, At Sadguru Shikhanpratista.\nISO 9001: Auditor/Lead Auditor course.\n \nWORK EXPERIENCE: \nCompany Name : QMS Certification Services Pvt.
