Pelton turbine is most efficient at this condition. Thus, more power power can \nbe extracted from a water source with high pressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure \nand high flow, even when the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made \nin all sizes. \n \nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING \n1.
