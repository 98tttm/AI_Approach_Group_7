At the same time it is may be easier to modify and misuse the valuable\ninformation through hacking. Reversible data hiding (RDH) in encrypted images\nmaintains the excellent property that the original cover can be losslessly recovered after\nembedded data is extracted while protecting the image contents confidentiality. In this\nmethod by reserving room before encryption with a traditional RDH algorithm is used .\nFurthermore, this method can achieve real reversibility, separate data extraction and\ngreatly improvement on the quality of marked decrypted Images data extraction and\nimage recovery are free of any error\nAdditional Qualification\nDIPLOMA in Hardware and Networking\nAttended Telecom training at RTTC,Trivandrum\nMain Project : B.TECH\nTeam Size: 4\nPeriod: 3 months\nSkills: Design, Programming in VHDL, Simulation in Xilinx\nEnvironment: Xilinx\nOperating System: Windows 2007\nDescription: \nThe HF radar receiver system used for ionospheric measurements, installed at VSSC,\nTrivandrum. The HF radar system used here works mainly on 18 MHz.. This signal is\namplified to 50kW peak power in the transmitter and is fed to the antenna. This\nelectromagnetic energy is radiated into space by antenna array. The backscattered signal from\nthe irregularities are passed through a coherent receiver where the signal is phase detected\nusing two reference signals having quadrature phase relationship. The in phase and quadrature\nphase outputs of the two phase detectors (sine and cosine channels) have all the information\ncontained in the backscattered received signal. As a part of augmentation, the receiver system\nof the HF radar to a state-of-the-art Digital Receiver using FPGA technology is to be carried\nout. \nSpecial Skills\n\nVersatile\n\nGood Interpersonal skill\n\nOptimistic\n\nHardworking & Ability to work in a team\nSoftware Skills\n\nOffice Package: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Microsoft \nPowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook Express\n\nLanguages: VHDL ,C.\n\nFPGA Development (Altera, Xilinx)\n\nAnalog Development: Resolver-to-Digital Converters, A/D Converters, D/A \nConverters\n\nSoftware tools: MATLAB, Simulink, Xilinx\nArea of Interest\n\nCommunication system\n\n Networking\n\nNetwork Security\nConference Profile\n\nPresented a Paper on REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING IN ENCRYPTED\nIMAGES at International Conference on 20th February 2015.\nREFERENCES\nDr. Paul A.J Ph.D\nHead Of Department\nElectroncis and Communication\nMusaliar College Of Engineering and Technology\nPathanamthita\nDr.R.P Anto Kumar Ph.D\nHead Of Department\nIT Department\nST.Xavier`s Catholic College Of Engineering and Technology\nKanyakumari\nPersonal Profile\n Fathers name \n: Koshy V.G\n Mothers name \n : Suma koshy\n Date of Birth \n: 03.11.1989\n Gender\n: Female\n Nationality : Indian\n Marital Status \n : Single\n Languages Known \n: Malayalam, English, Tamil, Hindi\n Mother Tongue\n: Malayalam\n Experience : Fresher\nDeclaration\n I (Manju Merin Koshy) hereby declare that the above details furnished by me are\ntrue to the best of my knowledge.\n \nPlace : MAVELIKARA \nDate\n: 31-08-2015 MANJU MERIN \nKOSHY"}
