It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other\nplaces. The device uses one or more simple machines to create mechanical advantage and\nthus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed\nin the transport industry for the loading and unloading of freight, in\nthe construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry\nfor the assembling of heavy equipment.\nProject Title: FLY WHEEL\n Description: A flywheel is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently\nstore rotational energy. Flywheels resist changes in rotational speed by their moment of\ninertia. The amount of energy stored in a flywheel is proportional to the square of\nits rotational speed. The way to change a flywheel stored energy is by increasing or\ndecreasing its rotational speed applying a torque aligned with its axis of symmetry.\nACHIEVEMENTS / CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES / EXTRA CURRICULAR\nACTIVITIES:\nAuto CAD And Pro/E Certificate.\nBharat Vikash Parishad Certificate.\nINPLANT TRAINING / INDUSTRIAL VISIT:\nANIL SPECIAL STEEL INDUSTRIES LTD JAIPUR 1 JUNE 2013 TO 30 JUNE 2013\nPERSONAL PROFILE:\nFathers Name\n:Ram Chandra Bairwa\nDate of Birth \n: 05th April 1990\nGender \n: Male \nPassport Number\n: M4017503\nLanguage Known \n: English And Hindi\n Hobbies \n: Singing Songs,Listening Music,Reading Books,Social\n \nServices.\nAddress \n: 186,Anantwada Ka Gola, Bairwa Ki Dhani,Post-\n \n \n \n \nAnantwada,Via-Bandikui,Tehsil-Baswa,District-\nDausa,Rajasthan,India-303313.\nDECLARATION:\nI hereby declare that the above particulars furnished by me are true to the best of my knowledge\nand belief. \nDate:25th July 2017\nPlace: Jaipur \n Bhagwan Sahay Bairwa"}
