(May 2014-June 2014) \nEngineering Project Synopsis (Industrial Training) \n \n Project Title : Analysis on Electromagnetic Repulsion Force for Enhancement in Repulsion Threshold \nCurrent of Contact System of 250 A Frame MCCB. \n Company: Larsen and Toubro (Electrical and Automation) Ltd, Vadodara. \n Objective : This project is initiated by carrying out detailed study of the factors and design constraints \nrelated to repulsion threshold current (Irp) of the MCCB. Present design analyzed on JMAG/ANSYS \nMaxwell to find out their limitations, Based on that find out simulation results & new concepts for \ncontact system of the MCCB is generate. Project objective is to enhance repulsion threshold current \n(Irp) of contact system of 250 A frame MCCB. Electromagnetic repulsion forces generated between \nmoving & fixed contacts are of repulsive nature due to opposite direction of current path. The \nmechanical force offered by MCCB mechanism opposes these Electromagnetic repulsion forces. In this \nproject contact pressure (CP) offered by contact springs will be a constant. \n Duration: 1 year (July 2014-April 2015) \n \n Project Title : Generator Protection & Testing of Relays. \n Company: Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd, Thermal Power Station, Gandhinagar. \n Objective : The objective of this project is to understand all about generator protection schemes & \ntheir settings, testing of some protection relay using micro-controller. To protect the generator against \nthe over current, differential and turbine to boiler trip with help of instantaneous micro-controller \nbased relay, one can practically implement this program. Programming is done in Code Vision AVR \nsoftware and simulated in Proteus software. Result of this simulation is implemented in hardware. \nHardware results are same as software result. These programs can be used as reference in power plant \nindustries. \n Duration: 1 year.
