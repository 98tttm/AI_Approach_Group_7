Das\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering\nPennsylvania State University\n354F IST Building, University park, PA 16802\n(814) 865-0194\nemail: das@cse.psu.edu\nURL: http://www.cse.psu.edu/das/\nChita joined Penn State as an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nin 1986, and is currently a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Department. His\nresearch interests are on parallel and distributed computer architectures, cluster/grid computing, communi-\ncation networks and communication mechanisms, resource management, multi-core/System-on-Chip (SoC)\narchitectures, Internet QoS, performance evaluation, fault-tolerant computing, mobile computing, multi-\nmedia systems, and security. For the last twenty two years, he has taught a variety of undergraduate and\ngraduate courses in these areas and has supervised 22 Ph.D. students, more than 50 M.S. students, and 15+\nB.S. (Honors) students. Twelve of his students are now working as faculty members, and two of them are\ndepartment heads.\nThe main theme of Chitas research is on the design and evaluation of high performance computer and\ncommunication architectures. In this context, he has worked on several designs which were used in prior\ncommercial parallel architectures like IBM RP3 and Intel Paragon. He is currently working on multi-core\narchitectures which will be the main computing paradigm in next few years. In particular, he has worked\nextensively on the wormhole switching technique, which is currently used as the communication fabric in\ndesigning high performance computers and clusters. The most recent communication architecture, called\nInniBand Architecture (IBA), that is used for designing clusters with hundreds and thousands of processors\nutilizes wormhole switching.\nChita has published consistently in the above areas in highly reputed international journals (such as the\nIEEE Transactions on Computers (TC) and IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)),\nand highly selective conference proceedings (such as ISCA, HPCA,ICDCS, MICRO, SIGMETRICS, ICPP,\nFTCS/DSN, ICS, ISPLED, and SPAA), all of which have a typical acceptance rate of 10%-20%. Three of\nhis papers have received the Best Paper Award in three different conferences (ICPP, ICDCS, and PRDC),\nand two additional papers were nominated for the Best Paper Award. His research has been funded by\nseveral agencies, in particular the National Science Foundation (NSF) continuously for over 20 years. In the\nlast ve years, he has been a PI/Co-PI of research grants totaling more than $6.0 million.\nChita, an IEEE Fellow, has served the professional society in several capacities. He was on the editorial\nboards of the IEEE TC and IEEE TPDS, the two best international journals in computer architectures. He\nhas sevred as the Chair of TCDP, and is currently the Chair of the IEEE Computer Society Fellow Selection\nCommittee and the Chair of the IEEE CS Conference Publication Operations Committee (CPOC). He has\nsevred as a program committee member, program chair, and general chair of several conferences/workshops.\n1"}
