When any fault like short circuit \noccurs, voltage drop will vary depending on the length of fault in cable, since the \ncurrent varies. \n we detect the exact location of short circuit fault in the underground cable from \nfeeder end in kilometers by using microcontroller 8051. So, it can be easily detected \nand repaired. \nCOMPUTER SKILLS \n Languages \n : basics of C, C++ \n Packages \n \n: MS office \n Designing Tools \n: Matlab, \n Operating Systems \n: Windows XP, 07, 08 \nPROFICIENCY IN LANGUAGE \nLanguage \nSpeak \nRead \nWrite \nEnglish \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTamil \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n PERSONAL DETAILS \n Fathers Name \n \n: \nMr. A.
