PROJECT REPORT ON\nSynthesis and Antibacterial Activity of N-Substituted Succinaamide\nA SHORT RESEARCH PROJECT :-\nA research project on synthesis and antibacterial activities of N-substituted succinamide compounds\nsuccinamide\ncompound used as therapeutic agents interesting for the synthesis of biologically active compounds aniline and its derivative\nexhibit variety of biologically active action antibacterial ,antiviral, anticancer and antifungal agents succinamide is well arthritic\ndiseases eye diseases such as the proliferative retinopathies. Neovascular glaucoma and ocular tumors angiofibromas, and\nhemangiomass. \nPreviously dual antitumor and anti-inflammatory activity of a series substituted succcinamic acid have reported (1-4) synthesis\nand biologically activity of substituted amides and hydrazides 1,4 dicarboxylic acids have been recently reviewed in an novel\n2\nsuccinamide as antitumour.Succinamide derivatives processes for their prepration and their use as gelatlnase and collagenase\ninhibitors.\nAntibacterial activity efficiency of N-substituted succinamide compound against two bacterial species viz. Staphylococcus\naurecus and protease vulgaries.\nAll the compounds like\n1-phenyl pyrrolidine 2,5 dione\n1(4-methyl phenyl)pyrrlidine2,5 dione\nP-methoxy N-phenyl succinamide\nN,N(4,4 Diphenyl methane)succinamide\nShows antibacterial efficiency for this species\nR E FR E NC E\nprof.
