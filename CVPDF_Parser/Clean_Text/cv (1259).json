I found myself increasingly drawn to understanding the science behind the technology, and \ndecided to pursue a career in Electrical Engineering. \n \nAs a Student Engineer Intern at The Boeing Company for a year and a half, I have had the opportunity \nto learn about 3D modeling on CATIA V5. Collaborating with a team of electrical engineers, I have \nworked on wiring design projects for the raceway cabin, onboard networking systems, and lower lobes \nof various 7-series airplanes. In addition, I have also worked as an Engineer Assistant at LKK \nManufacturing, where I had the chance to learn about working with suppliers, logistics, and mechanics \nto put together efficient production schedules that meet sales and business needs. \n \nI would like to be a candidate for the Manufacturing Line Manager and 3D modeling positions, as my \nexperience in 3D modeling and managing the daily tasks of running a manufacturing plant is highly \napplicable for the position. Alternatively, I would like to be on the systems team. Given the chance, I \nwould like to work on the Prusa i3 dual extrusion head or the bio-printer projects. \n \nI look forward to hearing from you about the opportunity to join the EE 400D Robot Company. \n \nSincerely, \n \nJennifer So \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJENNIFER SO \nADDRESS \nPHONE:  EMAIL: \n \nOBJECTIVE \nSeeking a Manufacturing Line Manager position at the EE 400D Robot Company. \n \nEDUCATION \nBachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering \n \n \n \n \nDecember 2013 \nCalifornia State University, Long Beach \n \nBachelor of Arts in Psychology \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n March 2009 \nUniversity of California, Los Angeles \n \n \n \nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE \nThe Boeing Company, Student Engineer Intern Long Beach, CA \n \n March 2012  Present \nELECTRICAL ENGINEERING - WIRE DESIGN AND INSTALLATION \n \n June 2013  Present \n \nDesign wiring using 3D modeling tools such as CATIA for raceway and lower lobe on 7-series airplanes \n \nMaintain wire harness detail and assembly design on 737 cabin raceway using CATIA V5, Enovia, and WIRS \n \nConvert wire harness assembly of raceway models from CATIA V4 to V5 \n \nPRODUCT SUPPORT ENGINEERING - FAULT ISOLATION \n \n March 2012  June 2013 \n \nCreated fault isolation procedures in FIM for airplane avionics, electrical, lighting, and hydraulic systems with \nthe use of wiring diagrams and system schematics \n \nUpdated FIM troubleshooting procedures for electrical components and electrical systems \n \nTeamed with the e-MOD organization to convert older, non-SGML troubleshooting documents into modern \nSGML data, and enhance Fault Isolation Manual products to include digital services to all airline customers \n \nLKK Manufacturing, Engineer Assistant \n \nIndustry, CA \n \n June 2010  March 2012 \n \nWork with vendors, logistics and mechanics to create production schedules that meet sales and business goals \n \nTracked inventory, monitored daily usage trends for production line, and managed logistics of machinery parts \n \nMaintained contractor and vendor relations to obtain necessary building maintenance services, machinery parts, \nand engineering tools for optimal pricing and quality \n \nComcast Networks, E!
