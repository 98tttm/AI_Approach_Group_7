main area of my research is on parallel and distributed computer architectures, and can be can be\ncategorized into the following themes: evaluation of multiprocessor architectures, design and analysis\nof routers and network architectures, resource management in multiprocessors, and cluster systems.\nduring my tenure at penn state, i have supervised 21 ph.d. students, more than 50 m.s. students and about\n12 b.s. honors students in these areas. my research results have appeared in top quality international\njournals (such as ieee tpds, ieee tc, jpdc) and highly selective conference proceedings (such as\nisca, hpca, micro, sigmetrics, icdcs, icpp, ipdps, ics, ispled, and spaa), and the research\nhas been supported by various funding agencies. in the last ve years, i have been a pi/co-pi of reserch\ngrants totaling to more than 5.8m. here is a brie y description of my contributions in each of these areas\n(with pointers to selected publications) followed by an outline of my current research work.\nevaluation of multiprocessor architectures\nperformance and dependability (reliability/availability) evaluation of multiprocessor architectures is essen-\ntial to assess whether a design meets the high-level requirements, to identify design bottlenecks, to select\nan optimal architecture for speci c requirements, and to design better systems in the future. however, eval-\nuation of such architectures becomes extremely complex when the underlying communication network is\nincluded in the model. therefore, most prior research refrained from including the network architecture in\nevaluating multiprocessor systems.\nthe uniqueness of my evaluation work is the inclusion of the underlying interconnection network in de-\nveloping performance, dependability, and performance-related dependability (performability) models for\nvarious parallel machines. we have developed elegant performance and dependability models for various\narchitectures such as bus-based systems 1 , hypercubes ( 10 , 14 , 24 , 44 , 53 ), min-based systems\n( 11 , 22 , 47 ), mesh-connected systems 18 , k-ary-n-cubes 77 , and clusters 12 . speci cally, the\nanalytical model for the hypercube network with wormhole switching mechanism 51 was the rst accu-\nrate technique that captured the chained blocking possible in wormhole switching. this work received the\nieee computer society outstanding paper award at the international conference on distributed comput-\ning systems (icdcs), 1991.\ndesign and analysis of routers and network architectures\na high-throughput, low-latency communication network is essential to building a scalable, high perfor-\nmance multiprocessor. the network topology, switching mechanism, message routing algorithm, and ap-\nplication workload together determine performance of a network. while my research over the years has\nlooked into various aspects of designing high performance networks, i have speci cally worked on devel-\noping ef cient routing algorithms for direct networks, evaluation of networks with realistic workloads, and\ndesigning faster routers/switches. we have developed partially and fully adaptive routing algorithms for\nhypercubes and meshes that require minimal number of virtual channels (vcs) to provide deadlock free-\ndom (no vc for partially adaptive routing in n-dimensional meshes 64 and 2 virtual channels for fully\nadaptive routing algorithm 66 ). in addition, we have developed an analytical model to capture virtual\nchannel ow control and routing adaptivity in hypercubes ( 72 ). extension of these algorithms to handle\nlink and node faults in a network has also been proposed 73 .\nwhile the research on network design and analysis is quite rich, very little work was done in evaluating\nnetworks with realistic workloads. the three communication attributes that are required for any network\nperformance study are the message inter-arrival time distribution with the corresponding generation rate,\nthe spatial distribution of messages or the traf c pattern, and the message size (volume). typical synthetic\nenvironments have assumed that the temporal distribution is exponential, the spatial distribution is uniform\nor a few localized communication patterns, and the message size is a xed number of bytes. while eval-\nuations with such synthetic workloads have been accused of providing inaccurate performance estimates,\nperformance evaluation with realistic workloads is quite complex and challenging. in this regard, we\n16\nhave initiated research on workload characterization of parallel applications and application-driven per-\nformance evaluation 78 . using the temporal, spatial and volume attributes of communications, we have\nanalyzed the communication properties of shared memory and distributed memory applications. it has been\nshown that it is possible to quantify the temporal and spatial behavior of parallel applications using known\nmathematical distributions, which in turn can be used in application-driven performance evaluation. the\nimpact of performance enhancement features such as virtual channel ow control and routing adaptivity\nwith realistic workloads has been analyzed ( 29 , 79 ).\ndesign of fast routers is essential not only to build scalable interconnects, but also to enhance the perfor-\nmance of the entire system. we have developed a pipelined router architecture, called lapses (look-ahead\nrouting, intelligent path selection, and economic storage) that uses a minimal size routing table in support-\ning any routing algorithm in a regular network 86 .\nresource management in multiprocessors\nprudent management of system resources is essential to maximize the system throughput and utilization,\nwhile minimizing the average response time in a multi-user environment. resource management in multi-\nprocessors is a well researched area. it consists of two steps processor allocation and job scheduling. pro-\ncessor allocation is concerned with allocating the parallel processes of a job to processors, while scheduling\ndecides the next job/process for execution. both these techniques complement each other in maximizing\nthe delivered performance of a multiprocessor. primarily contiguous allocation of processors to processes\nof a parallel job has been used to minimize the communication overhead, and thus improve the performance\nof closely-coupled multiprocessors. since dynamic allocation is an np-complete problem, a plethora of\nallocation algorithms for different multiprocessors have been proposed with varying degree of allocation\nability and complexity.\nwe have proposed ef cient processor allocation algorithms for hypercubes ( 8 , 46 , 69 ), mins ( 16 ),\nand k-ary n-cubes/meshes ( 25 , 74 , 80 ). in particular, the free list policy 46 , proposed for the hyper-\ncube multiprocessors, received the daniel slotnick award for the best original paper at the 1989 interna-\ntional conference on parallel processing (icpp). an elegant scheduling algorithm, called lazy scheduling\nwas proposed ( 17 ) to boost the hypercube performance further.\ncluster systems\ncluster systems, also known as network of workstations/pcs (now), are becoming a predominant and\ncost-effective style for designing scalable, high performance computers. these systems are gaining ac-\nceptance not just in scienti c applications but also in emerging commercial applications such as database\nservers and web servers. the tremendous surge in dynamic web contents, multimedia objects, e-commerce,\nand other web-enabled applications requires providing high performance and quality-of-service (qos) sup-\nport in clusters.\nmy research on cluster systems has focused on three issues: design of high performance cluster inter-\nconnects, qos provisioning in cluster interconnects, and scheduling techniques for clusters. in the area\nof high performance cluster interconnects, we have looked into the design of routers and network inter-\nfaces (nis). we have set up a now laboratory to conduct various types of theoretical and experimental\nresearch. in particular, we are exploring the feasibility of providing qos support in commercially success-\nful wormhole-switched routers. we have proposed a new wormhole router, called mediaworm, that can\nsupport integrated traf c in clusters ( 32 , 91 ). recently, we have proposed modi cations to the industry\nstandard virtual interface architecture (via) to ef ciently support real-time traf c in the ni 95 . a num-\nber of interesting research issues involving hardware and software mechanisms to provide qos support\nin routers, and modi cations to user-level communication mechanisms for qos provisioning are currently\nbeing investigated ( 98 , 100 ).\nunlike tightly-coupled multiprocessors, coscheduling of parallel processes in a loosely-coupled cluster\nis much more challenging because of the individual node autonomy, and relatively high communication\n17\noverhead. therefore, a few other scheduling alternatives such as dynamic coscheduling (dcs) and implicit\ncoscheduling (ics, sb) have been proposed in the literature. these schemes use the locally available mes-\nsage arrival information to schedule communicating processes of a job simultaneously. using the user-level\ncommunication strategies such as u-net, fast message, and via, they are shown to be quite ef cient. we\nhave proposed a design spectrum for implementing nine different coscheduling algorithms and in particu-\nlar have proposed an ef cient scheme, called periodic boost that is shown to be more ef cient on solaris\nplatforms ( 27 , 87 ). all these algorithms have been implemented on an ultrasparc workstation cluster,\nconnected by myrinet. this experimental testbed can be used for studying many scheduling alternatives.\nany off-the-shelf mpi applications can run on this platform.\nsince the implementation of any prior coscheduling algorithm needs substantial effort, we have developed\na generic framework for implementing any coscheduling algorithm on a linux cluster 116 . in addition,\nwe have proposed a new coscheduling, called coordinated coscheduling (cc), which has the potential to\noutperform all prior techniques 115 . this framework and the cc scheme has been implemented on a\nmyrinet connected 16-node linux cluster on top of via and gm. also, we have shown that it is possible\nto gain signi cant performance bene ts by employing coscheduling algorithms on commercial platforms,\nwhich currently use various forms of batch scheduling. we are now porting the framework and the cc\nscheme to large linux platforms to test with various scienti c workloads. this experimental research is\nconducted in collaboration with the lawrence livermore national laboratory (llnl) and penn state s\nmain computing center.\ncurrent research\nmy current work on cluster systems emphasizes on practical scheduling algorithms, qos support in the\ncluster interconnects and nics, and design of energy-ef cient interconnects. for the scheduling work,\nwe want to develop practical coscheduling algorithms that can provide better performance than the batch\nscheduling. the qos support research is conducted in collaboration with intel and other members of the\nin niband trade association (ibta). our simple congestion control technique ( 105 , 109 ) is currently\nbeing examined by several ibta members for inclusion in the iba speci cation. clusters are now used\nfor designing data centers that include web servers, application servers and database servers. we are now\nexamining the impact of user-level communication and coscheduling algorithms on the performance of\ncluster-based data centers. in addition, energy consumption in clusters has become a serious concern due\nto their high power budgets. also, the critical nature of many internet-based services demand high server\navailability. therefore, design of high performance, energy-ef cient, and dependable clusters has become\na pressing issue from socio-economic and environmental standpoints. in collaboration with our vlsi\ngroup, i have started design and analysis of energy-ef cient cluster interconnects 114 . in particular, we\nhave proposed a dynamic link shut down scheme, called dls, to conserve energy. compared to the prior\ndynamic voltage scaling (dvs) technique that incurs signi cant performance penalty, the dls scheme\ncan provide a better tradeoff between performance and power. we are also investigating the dependability\nimplications of energy-ef cient designs. furthermore, i am expanding my research to network-on-chip\n(noc) architectures to design soc systems. due to my inherent interest, i will attempt to develop per-\nformance and dependability models for such systems considering various practical limitations, and will\nconduct workload characterization of scienti c and commercial applications for clusters.\nthe qos ideas in the router have many similarities to the qos concept in the internet. i am currently\nsupervising two ph.d. students on internet qos. we are developing a control theoretic approach to analyze\nand design various active queue management (aqm) schemes for internet congestion control ( 106 , 107 , 118 , 119 ). we have designed an aqm scheme, which can detect non-responsive tcp and udp ows, and thus, can be used to dynamically quarantine such ows 120 . also, i am currently expanding my\nresearch to wireless/mobile/ad hoc systems. a ph.d. student is examining the advantage of using caching\nfor combining ad hoc networks with the wired internet for universal information accessibility ( 112,117 ).\n18\nmulticore/soc archietectures\ndesign and analysis of data centers\n19"
